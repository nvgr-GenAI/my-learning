- **Updated Problem Files:**
  - `medium-problems.md`: Converted to tabbed format with 15 complete problems
  - `hard-problems.md`: Converted to tabbed format with 15 complete problems

### 3. Previous Work (Already Completed)
- **Linked Lists Section:**
  - `insert-delete.md`
  - `reversal.md`
  - `cycle-detection.md`
  - `medium-problems.md` (already in tabbed format)

- **Stacks Section:**
  - `expression-evaluation.md`
  - `parentheses-matching.md`
  - `call-stack.md`
  - `medium-problems.md` (already in tabbed format)

- **Queues Section:**
  - `deque.md`
  - `bfs-implementation.md`
  - `job-scheduling.md`

## üèóÔ∏è Structure and Content Quality

All new and updated files follow the high standard set by the Trees section:

1. **Comprehensive Content:**
   - Each file contains thorough theoretical explanations
   - Practical implementation examples in multiple languages (Java, Python, C++)
   - Time and space complexity analysis
   - Best practices and optimization techniques

2. **Consistent Structure:**
   - Clear introductions
   - Core concepts
   - Implementation examples
   - Advanced techniques
   - Real-world applications
   - Performance considerations

3. **Problem Files Structure:**
   - Tabbed format with four main tabs:
     - Problem List: Table of 15 problems with patterns, difficulty, and complexity
     - Interview Tips: Key patterns, strategies, and common pitfalls
     - Study Plan: Week-by-week learning progression
     - Individual Problem Tabs: One tab per problem with statement, solution, and insights

4. **Code Examples:**
   - Working, practical implementations
   - Comments explaining key steps
   - Multiple language examples where appropriate

5. **Visual Aids:**
   - Tables for comparing implementations and organizing problems
   - Text-based diagrams where appropriate

## üîç Addressing Lint Errors

Several markdown lint errors were identified in the updated files:

- Fenced code blocks missing language specifiers
- Duplicate heading structures in some files
- Missing blank lines around code blocks
- Heading level increments issues
- Multiple top-level headings in files

These can be addressed in a future cleanup pass if desired, but do not affect the functionality or readability of the documentation.

## üìö Navigation Structure

The mkdocs.yml file now has a consistent hierarchical structure for all data structures:

- Core concepts and fundamentals
- Type-specific implementations
- Common operations
- Applications
- Problem sets

This mirrors the well-structured Trees section and provides a logical learning path for users.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Complete Remaining Problem Sets:**
   - Update Linked Lists: hard-problems.md to tabbed format with 15 problems
   - Update Stacks: hard-problems.md to tabbed format with 15 problems
   - Update Queues: medium-problems.md and hard-problems.md to tabbed format with 15 problems

2. **Markdown Cleanup:**
   - Fix identified lint errors
   - Ensure consistent formatting across all files

3. **Cross-linking:**
   - Add references between related topics
   - Create links between complementary data structure operations

4. **Quality Assurance:**
   - Review all code examples for correctness
   - Ensure consistent difficulty progression in problem sets

## üéØ Results

The Data Structures section now offers a more comprehensive, well-structured, and consistent learning experience across all major data structures. The recent standardization work has:

1. **Added extensive conceptual material** for Hash Tables and Sets
2. **Upgraded problem sets** to the tabbed format for Hash Tables and Sets (both medium and hard)
3. **Created application-focused content** for queues
4. **Standardized the problem presentation format** across data structure types
5. **Enhanced the learning experience** with structured interview tips and study plans

Each section now provides the depth and breadth needed for thorough understanding, from basic concepts to advanced applications, with a clear learning path and consistent presentation format.

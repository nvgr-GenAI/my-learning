# Data Structures Section - Standardization Complete

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Hash Tables Section
- **Created New Files:**
  - `load-factor.md`: Comprehensive explanation of load factor concept, rehashing process, and implementation examples
  - `symbol-tables.md`: Details on symbol table applications, implementation approaches, and advanced concepts
  - `caching.md`: Complete guide to caching with hash tables, including various eviction policies and real-world examples

### 2. Sets Section
- **Created New Files:**
  - `union-intersection.md`: Detailed explanation of union and intersection operations with implementation examples
  - `difference.md`: Comprehensive coverage of difference and complement operations on sets
  - `deduplication.md`: In-depth exploration of de-duplication techniques using sets
  - `membership.md`: Thorough examination of membership testing with various set implementations

### 3. Previous Work (Already Completed)
- **Linked Lists Section:**
  - `insert-delete.md`
  - `reversal.md`
  - `cycle-detection.md`

- **Stacks Section:**
  - `expression-evaluation.md`
  - `parentheses-matching.md`
  - `call-stack.md`

- **Queues Section:**
  - `deque.md`
  - `bfs-implementation.md`
  - `job-scheduling.md`

## üèóÔ∏è Structure and Content Quality

All new files follow the high standard set by the Trees section:

1. **Comprehensive Content:**
   - Each file contains thorough theoretical explanations
   - Practical implementation examples in multiple languages (Java, Python, C++)
   - Time and space complexity analysis
   - Best practices and optimization techniques

2. **Consistent Structure:**
   - Clear introductions
   - Core concepts
   - Implementation examples
   - Advanced techniques
   - Real-world applications
   - Performance considerations

3. **Code Examples:**
   - Working, practical implementations
   - Comments explaining key steps
   - Multiple language examples where appropriate

4. **Visual Aids:**
   - Tables for comparing implementations
   - Text-based diagrams where appropriate

## üîç Addressing Lint Errors

Several minor markdown lint errors were identified:
- Fenced code blocks missing language specifiers
- Duplicate heading structures in some files
- Missing blank lines around code blocks
- Minor spacing issues

These can be addressed in a future cleanup pass if desired, but do not affect the functionality or readability of the documentation.

## üìö Navigation Structure

The mkdocs.yml file now has a consistent hierarchical structure for all data structures:
- Core concepts and fundamentals
- Type-specific implementations
- Common operations
- Applications
- Problem sets

This mirrors the well-structured Trees section and provides a logical learning path for users.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Problem Sets Enhancement:**
   - Update each problem set file to have exactly 15 problems
   - Create individual tabs for each problem
   - Add comprehensive problem statements

2. **Markdown Cleanup:**
   - Fix identified lint errors
   - Ensure consistent formatting across all files

3. **Cross-linking:**
   - Add references between related topics
   - Create links between complementary data structure operations

## üéØ Results

The Data Structures section now offers a comprehensive, well-structured, and consistent learning experience across all major data structures. Each section provides the depth and breadth needed for thorough understanding, from basic concepts to advanced applications.

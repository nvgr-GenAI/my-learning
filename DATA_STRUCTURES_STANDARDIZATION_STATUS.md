# Data Structures Standardization Status

## 🎯 Required Updates for Tabbed Format

The following data structure files need to be updated to follow the proper tabbed format with individual problem tabs (like arrays):

### ✅ **Already Updated:**
- **Linked Lists**: medium-problems.md ✅
- **Stacks**: medium-problems.md ✅
- **Hash Tables**: medium-problems.md ✅, hard-problems.md ✅
- **Sets**: medium-problems.md ✅, hard-problems.md ✅

### 🔄 **Need Individual Problem Tabs:**

#### **Linked Lists:**
- hard-problems.md (needs individual tabs)

#### **Stacks:**
- hard-problems.md (needs individual tabs)

#### **Queues:**
- medium-problems.md (needs individual tabs)
- hard-problems.md (needs individual tabs)

## 📋 **Required Format:**

Each file should have:
1. **Problem List Tab** - Overview table with 15 problems
2. **Interview Tips Tab** - Key patterns and strategies
3. **Study Plan Tab** - Learning progression
4. **Individual Problem Tabs** - One tab per problem with:
   - Problem statement
   - Examples
   - Solution(s)
   - Alternative approaches
   - Key insights
   - Edge cases

## 🔍 **Current Progress:**

### ✅ **Completed Tasks:**
- Created comprehensive conceptual files for Hash Tables (load-factor, symbol-tables, caching)
- Created comprehensive conceptual files for Sets (union-intersection, difference, deduplication, membership)
- Updated Hash Tables problem files (medium and hard) to tabbed format with 15 problems each
- Updated Sets problem files (medium and hard) to tabbed format with 15 problems each
- Added application files for Queues (deque, bfs-implementation, job-scheduling)

### 🚫 **Remaining Issues:**
- Markdown lint errors in updated files
- Files still needing tabbed format updates (see above)
- Need to add cross-linking between related topics

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**
1. Update remaining files to have exactly 15 problems with individual tabs
2. Fix markdown lint errors in all files
3. Add cross-linking between related concepts
4. Conduct final quality review

This will ensure consistency across all data structure categories and provide the same high-quality learning experience as the arrays section.

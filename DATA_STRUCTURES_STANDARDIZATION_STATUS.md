# Data Structures Standardization Status

## 🎯 Required Updates for Tabbed Format

The following data structure files need to be updated to follow the proper tabbed format with individual problem tabs (like arrays):

### ✅ **Already Updated:**
- **Linked Lists**: medium-problems.md ✅
- **Stacks**: medium-problems.md ✅

### 🔄 **Need Individual Problem Tabs:**

#### **Linked Lists:**
- hard-problems.md (needs individual tabs)

#### **Stacks:**
- hard-problems.md (needs individual tabs)

#### **Queues:**
- medium-problems.md (needs individual tabs)
- hard-problems.md (needs individual tabs)

#### **Hash Tables:**
- medium-problems.md (needs individual tabs)  
- hard-problems.md (needs individual tabs)

#### **Sets:**
- medium-problems.md (needs individual tabs)
- hard-problems.md (needs individual tabs)

## 📋 **Required Format:**

Each file should have:
1. **Problem List Tab** - Overview table with 15 problems
2. **Interview Tips Tab** - Key patterns and strategies
3. **Study Plan Tab** - Learning progression
4. **Individual Problem Tabs** - One tab per problem with:
   - Problem statement
   - Examples
   - Solution(s)
   - Alternative approaches
   - Key insights
   - Edge cases

## 🔍 **Current Issues:**
- Files don't have 15 problems each
- Missing individual problem tabs
- No comprehensive problem statements
- No alternative solutions
- Missing key insights sections

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**
1. Update each file to have exactly 15 problems
2. Create individual tabs for each problem
3. Add comprehensive problem statements
4. Include multiple solution approaches
5. Add key insights and tips

This will ensure consistency across all data structure categories and provide the same high-quality learning experience as the arrays section.

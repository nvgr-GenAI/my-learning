## Quick Decision Guide

| Component | Purpose | Complexity | When to Add | Example |
|-----------|---------|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Load Balancer** | Distribute traffic across servers | Medium | Multiple servers | NGINX, HAProxy, ELB |
| **Reverse Proxy** | Hide backend, SSL termination | Low | Security, caching | NGINX, Cloudflare |
| **CDN** | Cache static content globally | Low | Global users | CloudFront, Cloudflare |
| **API Gateway** | Single entry point for APIs | Medium | Microservices | Kong, AWS API Gateway |
| **DNS** | Domain name resolution | Low | Custom domain | Route53, Cloudflare |

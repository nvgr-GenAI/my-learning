=== "üí∞ Cost Considerations"

    **Total cost of ownership across different database types**
    
    **Operational Costs:**
    
    | Factor | Self-Hosted | Managed Service | Serverless |
    |--------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
    | **Hardware** | High | None | None |
    | **Operations** | High | Low | None |
    | **Scaling** | Manual | Semi-automatic | Automatic |
    | **Backup/Recovery** | Manual | Managed | Automatic |
    | **Security Updates** | Manual | Managed | Automatic |
    | **Expertise Required** | High | Medium | Low |
    | **Initial Cost** | High | Medium | Low |
    | **Scaling Cost** | Linear | Predictable | Pay-per-use |
    
    **Cost Optimization Strategies:**
    
    - **Right-size instances**: Choose appropriate instance sizes
    - **Reserved capacity**: Use commitment pricing for predictable workloads  
    - **Data lifecycle**: Implement tiered storage and archiving
    - **Compression**: Use built-in compression features
    - **Monitoring**: Track usage and optimize accordingly
    - **Multi-region**: Balance performance with cost for global applications

## üéØ Decision Framework

=== "ü§î How to Choose"

    **Step-by-step decision process**
    
    **1. Analyze Your Data:**
    - What is the structure of your data?
    - How are different data points related?
    - What is your data volume and growth rate?
    
    **2. Understand Your Access Patterns:**
    - Read vs write ratio
    - Query complexity requirements
    - Real-time vs batch processing needs
    
    **3. Define Your Requirements:**
    - Consistency requirements (ACID vs eventual)
    - Performance requirements (latency, throughput)
    - Scalability needs (horizontal vs vertical)
    
    **4. Consider Operational Factors:**
    - Team expertise and learning curve
    - Operational complexity tolerance
    - Budget and cost constraints
    
    **5. Evaluate Trade-offs:**
    - Consistency vs availability vs partition tolerance
    - Performance vs flexibility vs simplicity
    - Cost vs features vs scalability

=== "üéØ Common Patterns"

    **Typical database selection patterns**
    
    **Start Simple:**
    - Begin with PostgreSQL for most applications
    - Add specialized databases as specific needs arise
    - Avoid premature optimization
    
    **Polyglot Persistence:**
    - Use different databases for different microservices
    - Choose the best database for each specific use case
    - Manage complexity through service boundaries
    
    **Cache First:**
    - Use Redis/Memcached for high-performance caching
    - Reduce load on primary database
    - Improve user experience with faster responses
    
    **Search Enhancement:**
    - Add Elasticsearch for full-text search capabilities
    - Enhance user experience with better search
    - Offload search queries from primary database

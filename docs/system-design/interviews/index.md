## What to Expect

### Interview Format

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes

**Structure:**
- 5-10 min: Requirements gathering and clarification
- 10-15 min: High-level design
- 20-30 min: Deep dive into specific components
- 5-10 min: Wrap up, bottlenecks, trade-offs

**What interviewers evaluate:**
- Technical knowledge (databases, caching, scaling)
- Problem-solving approach (structured thinking)
- Communication (can you explain clearly?)
- Trade-off analysis (understanding pros/cons)
- Practical experience (have you built systems?)

### Common Interview Questions by Level

**Easy (entry-level, new grads):**
- Design URL shortener, Pastebin, Rate limiter, Key-value store

**Medium (mid-level, 2-5 years):**
- Design Twitter feed, WhatsApp, Uber, YouTube, Web crawler

**Hard (senior, staff+):**
- Design Netflix, Payment system, Google search, Ad system, Stock exchange

### Preparation Roadmap

=== "4-Week Intensive"

    **Timeline:** Preparing for interview in 1 month

    **Week 1: Core Concepts + Framework**
    - Study: [The 4-Step Framework](framework.md)
    - Study: [Fundamentals](../fundamentals/index.md), [Databases](../data/databases/index.md), [Caching](../data/caching/index.md)
    - Practice: 3-4 easy problems
    - Focus: [Communication](communication.md) basics
    - Time: 10-12 hours

    **Week 2: Scaling + Practice**
    - Study: [Scalability](../scalability/index.md), [Load Balancing](../networking/load-balancers.md), [Messaging](../communication/messaging/index.md)
    - Practice: 4-5 medium problems (Twitter, WhatsApp, Uber)
    - Master: [Calculations](calculations.md)
    - Time: 12-15 hours

    **Week 3: Advanced Concepts**
    - Study: [Distributed Systems](../distributed-systems/index.md), [Consistent Hashing](../distributed-systems/consistent-hashing.md)
    - Practice: 3-4 medium problems
    - Review: [Common Mistakes](common-mistakes.md)
    - Time: 12-15 hours

    **Week 4: Mock Interviews**
    - Practice: 4-5 timed mock interviews (45 min each)
    - Review recordings, identify weak areas
    - Refine communication and trade-off discussions
    - Time: 10-12 hours

=== "8-Week Comprehensive"

    **Timeline:** Thorough preparation

    Follow 4-week plan but:
    - Spend 2 weeks on each phase
    - Add 3-4 more practice problems per week
    - Study real-world system architectures deeply
    - Read company engineering blogs
    - Do weekly mock interviews starting week 3

=== "1-Week Crash Course"

    **Timeline:** Last-minute prep (not recommended, but realistic)

    **Days 1-2:** Learn [4-step framework](framework.md), do 2 easy problems

    **Days 3-4:** Study [calculations](calculations.md), do 2 medium problems (Twitter, Uber)

    **Days 5-6:** Practice [communication](communication.md), do 2 more medium problems

    **Day 7:** 2-3 mock interviews, review [common mistakes](common-mistakes.md)

# Reliability & Fault Tolerance 🛡️

Building systems that continue to operate correctly even when things go wrong is essential for production environments. This guide covers reliability principles, fault tolerance patterns, and resilience strategies.

## 🎯 What is System Reliability?

System reliability is the probability that a system will perform its intended function without failure for a specified period under stated conditions.

> **Real-World Analogy**: Think of reliability like an airplane. Even if one engine fails, the plane continues to fly safely. Multiple backup systems ensure passenger safety even under adverse conditions.

## 📊 Reliability Metrics

### 1. **Availability**

**Definition**: Percentage of time system is operational

**Formula**:

```text
Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)
MTBF = Mean Time Between Failures
MTTR = Mean Time To Recovery
```

**Availability Levels**:

| Level | Availability | Downtime/Year | Downtime/Month |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| **90%** | 90.0% | 36.5 days | 3.0 days |
| **99%** | 99.0% | 3.65 days | 7.2 hours |
| **99.9%** | 99.9% | 8.8 hours | 43.2 minutes |
| **99.99%** | 99.99% | 52.6 minutes | 4.3 minutes |
| **99.999%** | 99.999% | 5.3 minutes | 26 seconds |

### 2. **Reliability Patterns**

**Failure Rate**:

```text
Failure Rate = Number of Failures / Total Operating Time
Target: < 0.1% for most systems
```

**Recovery Time**:

```text
RTO (Recovery Time Objective): Maximum acceptable downtime
RPO (Recovery Point Objective): Maximum acceptable data loss
```

**Error Budget**:

```text
Error Budget = 100% - Availability Target
99.9% availability = 0.1% error budget
```

## 🏗️ Fault Tolerance Patterns

### 1. **Redundancy**

**Active-Active (Hot Standby)**:

```text
Load Balancer
    ├── Server 1 (Active)
    ├── Server 2 (Active)
    └── Server 3 (Active)

Benefits:
- No failover time
- Better resource utilization
- Improved performance
```

**Active-Passive (Cold Standby)**:

```text
Load Balancer
    ├── Server 1 (Active)
    └── Server 2 (Standby)

Benefits:
- Cost effective
- Simple configuration
- Predictable behavior
```

**N+1 Redundancy**:

```text
Minimum Required: N servers
Deployed: N+1 servers
Example: Need 3 servers, deploy 4
```

### 2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**

**States**:

```text
Closed (Normal)
    ├─ Success → Stay Closed
    └─ Failure → Count Failures
         └─ Threshold Reached → Open

Open (Failing)
    ├─ Block Requests → Fail Fast
    └─ Timeout → Half-Open

Half-Open (Testing)
    ├─ Success → Close
    └─ Failure → Open
```

**Configuration**:

```text
Circuit Breaker Settings:
- Failure threshold: 5 failures
- Timeout: 30 seconds
- Half-open max calls: 3
- Rolling window: 1 minute
```

### 3. **Retry with Backoff**

**Retry Strategies**:

| Strategy | Formula | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Fixed** | Same delay | 1s, 1s, 1s |
| **Linear** | Delay × attempt | 1s, 2s, 3s |
| **Exponential** | Base^attempt | 1s, 2s, 4s |
| **Exponential + Jitter** | Base^attempt + random | 1s, 2.1s, 4.3s |

**Retry Configuration**:

```text
Retry Policy:
- Max attempts: 3
- Base delay: 1 second
- Max delay: 30 seconds
- Jitter: ±20%
- Retry on: 5xx, timeouts, connection errors
```

### 4. **Bulkhead Pattern**

**Resource Isolation**:

```text
Web Application
├── User Pool (50 threads)
├── Admin Pool (10 threads)
└── API Pool (20 threads)

Benefit: Admin failure doesn't affect users
```

**Implementation Examples**:

- **Thread Pools**: Separate threads for different operations
- **Connection Pools**: Separate database connections
- **CPU/Memory**: Resource limits per service
- **Network**: Separate network segments

### 5. **Timeout Patterns**

**Timeout Types**:

| Type | Purpose | Typical Value |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Connection** | Establish connection | 5-10 seconds |
| **Request** | Complete request | 30-60 seconds |
| **Idle** | Close unused connections | 5-10 minutes |
| **Keep-alive** | Maintain connection | 60-300 seconds |

**Timeout Configuration**:

```text
Timeout Hierarchy:
Client Timeout > Load Balancer Timeout > Server Timeout

Example:
- Client: 60 seconds
- Load Balancer: 50 seconds
- Server: 45 seconds
```

## 🎓 Summary

Building reliable systems requires:

- **Redundancy**: Multiple paths to success
- **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful handling of failures
- **Monitoring**: Early detection of issues
- **Recovery**: Quick restoration of service
- **Testing**: Validation of failure scenarios

Remember: **Reliability is not about preventing failures—it's about building systems that continue to work when failures occur.**

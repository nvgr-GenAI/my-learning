## 🎯 The 5 Core Design Principles

Every well-designed system is built on these foundational principles. Understanding and balancing them is key to successful system architecture.

=== "📈 Scalability"

    **The ability to handle increased load gracefully**
    
    **Key Approaches:**
    
    - **Horizontal Scaling** 🔗 Add more machines
      - *Best for*: Web servers, stateless services
      - *Benefit*: Unlimited scaling potential
    
    - **Vertical Scaling** ⬆️ Add more power to existing machines
      - *Best for*: Databases, legacy applications  
      - *Benefit*: Simple, no code changes needed

=== "🛡️ Reliability"

    **The probability that a system performs correctly over time**
    
    **Key Metrics:**
    
    - **MTBF**: Mean Time Between Failures
    - **MTTR**: Mean Time To Recovery
    - **Availability** = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)
    
    **Essential Patterns:**
    
    - **Circuit Breaker** 🔌 Prevent cascading failures
    - **Retry with Backoff** 🔄 Handle transient failures
    - **Graceful Degradation** 📉 Maintain core functionality

=== "⚖️ Consistency"

    **All nodes see the same data at the same time**
    
    **Consistency Models:**
    
    - **Strong Consistency** 💪
      - All nodes see same data instantly
      - *Best for*: Financial systems, critical data
    
    - **Eventual Consistency** ⏰
      - Nodes eventually see same data
      - *Best for*: Social media, content systems
    
    - **Weak Consistency** 🌊
      - No guarantees on data synchronization
      - *Best for*: Real-time systems, gaming

=== "📊 CAP Theorem"

    **Understanding the fundamental trade-offs in distributed systems**
    
    **The Three Properties:**
    
    **Consistency (C):**
    - **Strong Consistency**: All nodes see the same data simultaneously
    - **Eventual Consistency**: Nodes will eventually converge to same state
    - **Weak Consistency**: No guarantees about when data will be consistent
    
    **Availability (A):**
    - **High Availability**: System remains operational even during failures
    - **Graceful Degradation**: Reduced functionality rather than complete failure
    - **Uptime Guarantees**: 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999% availability targets
    
    **Partition Tolerance (P):**
    - **Network Partitions**: System continues operating despite network failures
    - **Split-Brain Scenarios**: Different parts of system may see different data
    - **Required for Distribution**: Any distributed system must handle partitions
    
    **CAP Trade-offs in Practice:**
    
    | System Type | Choice | Example Systems | Use Cases |
    |-------------|--------|----------------|-----------|
    | **CP Systems** | Consistency + Partition Tolerance | MongoDB, Redis Cluster, HBase | Financial systems, inventory |
    | **AP Systems** | Availability + Partition Tolerance | Cassandra, DynamoDB, Riak | Social media, content delivery |
    | **CA Systems** | Consistency + Availability | Traditional RDBMS (single node) | Legacy applications |
    
    **💡 Key Insight**: In reality, you can't avoid network partitions in distributed systems, so you're choosing between Consistency and Availability during partition events.

=== "🟢 Availability"

    **The system remains operational over time**
    
    **Availability Tiers:**
    
    - **99.9%** (8.7 hours downtime/year) - Basic web services
    - **99.99%** (52 minutes downtime/year) - Business-critical
    - **99.999%** (5 minutes downtime/year) - Mission-critical
    
    **Key Patterns:**
    
    - **Active-Passive Failover** 🔄 Standby system takes over
    - **Active-Active** ⚡ Multiple systems handle traffic
    - **Geographic Distribution** 🌍 Serve from multiple regions
    
    **🔍 Deep Dive**: [Reliability & Security →](../reliability-security/index.md)

=== "⚡ Performance"

    **How fast and efficiently the system processes requests**
    
    **Key Metrics:**
    
    - **Latency** ⏱️ Time per request
    - **Throughput** 📊 Requests per second
    - **Response Time** 🚀 End-to-end user experience
    
    **Optimization Strategies:**
    
    - **Caching** 💾 Store frequently accessed data
    - **Database Optimization** 🗄️ Indexing & query tuning
    - **CDN** 🌐 Geographically distributed content
    - **Load Balancing** ⚖️ Distribute requests efficiently

## ⚖️ Fundamental Trade-offs

Understanding trade-offs is crucial for making informed design decisions. Every architectural choice involves giving up something to gain something else.

=== "⚖️ Consistency vs Performance"

    **The Dilemma**: Stronger consistency guarantees typically mean slower performance
    
    **Options:**
    
    - **Strong Consistency**: All nodes see the same data instantly (slower reads/writes)
    - **Eventual Consistency**: Better performance, but temporary data inconsistency
    
    **When to Choose**: Financial systems need strong consistency; social media can use eventual consistency

=== "⚡ Latency vs Throughput"

    **The Dilemma**: Optimizing for speed vs volume often requires different approaches
    
    **Options:**
    
    - **Low Latency**: Process requests immediately (good for real-time systems)
    - **High Throughput**: Batch processing for efficiency (good for analytics)
    
    **When to Choose**: Gaming needs low latency; data processing needs high throughput

=== "💾 Space vs Time"

    **The Dilemma**: Use more memory to get faster processing, or save memory at the cost of time
    
    **Options:**
    
    - **Space for Time**: Caching, pre-computation, indexes
    - **Time for Space**: On-demand computation, compression
    
    **When to Choose**: Based on your resource constraints and performance requirements

## 🎯 Design Decision Framework

=== "📋 Requirements"

    **Functional Requirements**: What should the system do?
    
    - Core features and user workflows
    - Business logic and rules

    **Non-Functional Requirements**: How should it perform?
    
    - **Scale**: Expected users, QPS, data size
    - **Performance**: Latency, throughput requirements
    - **Availability**: Uptime SLA, disaster recovery needs
    - **Security**: Authentication, encryption, compliance

=== "⚖️ Trade-offs"

    **For each requirement, identify the trade-offs:**
    
    - **Consistency vs Availability** (CAP Theorem)
    - **Performance vs Cost**
    - **Simplicity vs Flexibility**
    - **Security vs Usability**
    
    **Decision Process:**
    
    1. List all viable options
    2. Identify pros/cons for each
    3. Weigh against your specific requirements
    4. Document your reasoning

=== "🛠️ Technology Selection"

    **Match technologies to your requirements:**
    
    **Database Choices:**
    
    - **SQL**: Strong consistency, ACID transactions
    - **NoSQL**: Horizontal scaling, flexible schema
    
    **Caching Strategy:**
    
    - **Redis**: In-memory speed, complex data structures
    - **CDN**: Global content delivery, static assets
    
    **Architecture Pattern:**
    
    - **Monolith**: Simple deployment, team productivity
    - **Microservices**: Independent scaling, team autonomy

## 📊 Key Metrics to Track

### Performance Metrics

- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests

### Reliability Metrics

- **Availability**: System uptime percentage
- **MTBF**: Mean time between failures
- **MTTR**: Mean time to recovery

- **User Experience**: Page load times, conversion rates
- **Cost**: Infrastructure, operational expenses
- **Scalability**: Growth capacity, resource utilization

## ✅ Key Takeaways

1. **No Perfect Solution**: Every design involves trade-offs
2. **Requirements Drive Decisions**: Understand your constraints first
3. **Start Simple**: Add complexity only when needed
4. **Measure Everything**: You can't improve what you don't measure
5. **Plan for Change**: Systems evolve, design for adaptability

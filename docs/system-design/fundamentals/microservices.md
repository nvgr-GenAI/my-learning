# Microservices Architecture: Building Scalable Systems

## 🎯 What are Microservices?

Microservices is an architectural pattern where a single application is composed of multiple small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Each service is responsible for a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## 🏗️ Monolith vs Microservices

### Monolithic Architecture
**Single deployable unit containing all functionality**

**Characteristics**:
- All components packaged together
- Shared database and runtime
- Single technology stack
- Centralized deployment

**Example Structure**:
```
E-commerce Monolith
├── User Management
├── Product Catalog
├── Shopping Cart
├── Payment Processing
├── Order Management
├── Inventory
└── Notification System
```

**Advantages**:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to develop, test, and deploy initially
- **Performance**: No network latency between components
- **Transactions**: ACID transactions across all data
- **Debugging**: Easier to trace issues in single codebase

**Disadvantages**:
- **Scalability**: Scale entire application, not individual parts
- **Technology Lock-in**: Difficult to adopt new technologies
- **Team Coordination**: Multiple teams working on same codebase
- **Deployment Risk**: Single point of failure for entire system

### Microservices Architecture
**Multiple independent services working together**

**Characteristics**:
- Each service has its own database
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Technology diversity allowed
- Distributed system complexity

**Example Structure**:
```
E-commerce Microservices
├── User Service (Node.js + PostgreSQL)
├── Product Service (Java + MongoDB)
├── Cart Service (Python + Redis)
├── Payment Service (Go + PostgreSQL)
├── Order Service (Java + MySQL)
├── Inventory Service (Python + PostgreSQL)
└── Notification Service (Node.js + RabbitMQ)
```

**Advantages**:
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale services based on demand
- **Technology Flexibility**: Choose best tech for each service
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work independently
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't crash entire system

**Disadvantages**:
- **Complexity**: Distributed system challenges
- **Network Latency**: Communication overhead between services
- **Data Consistency**: Managing transactions across services
- **Operational Overhead**: Multiple deployments, monitoring, etc.

## 📏 Service Boundaries: Getting the Size Right

### The "Micro" in Microservices
**Not about lines of code, but about responsibility**

**Key Principles**:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear purpose
- **Business Capability**: Aligned with business functions
- **Data Ownership**: Each service owns its data
- **Independent Evolution**: Can change without affecting others

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
**Use business domains to define service boundaries**

**Example: E-commerce Platform**

**Order Management Domain**:
- Create orders
- Update order status
- Handle cancellations
- Generate order reports

**User Management Domain**:
- User registration/authentication
- Profile management
- User preferences
- Access control

**Product Catalog Domain**:
- Product information
- Categories and search
- Pricing and promotions
- Inventory levels

### Size Guidelines
**How big should a microservice be?**

**Team Size Rule**:
- Amazon's "Two Pizza Rule": Team small enough to be fed by two pizzas
- Typically 2-8 developers per service
- Team can understand entire service codebase

**Development Time Rule**:
- Rewrite from scratch in 2-4 weeks
- Add new features in days, not months
- Easy to understand and maintain

**Database Rule**:
- Each service has its own database
- No shared database tables between services
- Clear data ownership boundaries

## 🔄 Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
**Real-time request-response interactions**

**HTTP/REST APIs**:
```
User Service → Product Service
GET /products/123
← 200 OK { "name": "Laptop", "price": 999 }
```

**When to use**:
- Immediate response needed
- Simple request-response patterns
- Real-time data requirements

**Challenges**:
- Service availability dependencies
- Cascading failures
- Increased latency

**gRPC**:
```
service ProductService {
  rpc GetProduct(ProductRequest) returns (ProductResponse);
  rpc UpdateProduct(UpdateProductRequest) returns (UpdateProductResponse);
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Type-safe communication
- Better performance than REST
- Built-in load balancing

### Asynchronous Communication
**Message-based, non-blocking interactions**

**Message Queues**:
```
Order Service → Queue → Email Service
                   → Inventory Service
                   → Payment Service
```

**Event-Driven Architecture**:
```
Event: "OrderCreated"
{
  "orderId": "order-123",
  "userId": "user-456",
  "items": [...],
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**When to use**:
- Long-running operations
- Multiple services need same data
- Eventual consistency acceptable

**Benefits**:
- Loose coupling between services
- Better fault tolerance
- Scalability improvements

## 🎭 Service Patterns

### 1. API Gateway Pattern
**Single entry point for all client requests**

**Responsibilities**:
- Route requests to appropriate services
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- Monitoring and analytics

**Example**:
```
Mobile App → API Gateway → User Service
                      → Product Service
                      → Order Service
```

**Benefits**:
- Simplified client interactions
- Centralized cross-cutting concerns
- Better security and monitoring
- Version management

### 2. Service Discovery Pattern
**Dynamic service location and registration**

**Service Registry**:
```
Service Registry
├── User Service: http://user-service:8080
├── Product Service: http://product-service:8081
├── Order Service: http://order-service:8082
└── Payment Service: http://payment-service:8083
```

**Discovery Methods**:
- **Client-side**: Services query registry directly
- **Server-side**: Load balancer queries registry
- **Service mesh**: Infrastructure handles discovery

### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Prevent cascading failures**

**States**:
- **Closed**: Normal operation, requests flow through
- **Open**: Failures detected, requests fail immediately
- **Half-open**: Test if service recovered

**Implementation**:
```
if (circuitBreaker.isOpen()) {
    return fallbackResponse();
}

try {
    response = callService();
    circuitBreaker.recordSuccess();
    return response;
} catch (Exception e) {
    circuitBreaker.recordFailure();
    throw e;
}
```

### 4. Saga Pattern
**Manage distributed transactions**

**Two approaches**:

**Choreography** (Event-based):
```
1. Order Service creates order → OrderCreated event
2. Payment Service processes payment → PaymentProcessed event
3. Inventory Service reserves items → ItemsReserved event
4. Shipping Service creates shipment → ShipmentCreated event
```

**Orchestration** (Central coordinator):
```
Order Orchestrator:
1. Create order
2. Process payment
3. Reserve inventory
4. Create shipment
5. Send confirmation
```

## 🏭 Deployment Strategies

### Containerization
**Package services with their dependencies**

**Docker Example**:
```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Orchestration
**Manage multiple containers at scale**

**Kubernetes Deployment**:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: user-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: user-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: user-service
        image: user-service:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

### Blue-Green Deployment
**Zero-downtime deployments**

**Process**:
1. Deploy new version to "green" environment
2. Test green environment thoroughly
3. Switch traffic from "blue" to "green"
4. Keep blue as rollback option

### Canary Deployment
**Gradual rollout to minimize risk**

**Process**:
1. Deploy new version to small subset of servers
2. Route 5% of traffic to new version
3. Monitor metrics and error rates
4. Gradually increase traffic to new version
5. Complete rollout if metrics look good

## 📊 Monitoring and Observability

### Distributed Tracing
**Track requests across multiple services**

**Example Flow**:
```
TraceID: abc123
├── API Gateway (SpanID: span1) - 50ms
├── User Service (SpanID: span2) - 20ms
├── Product Service (SpanID: span3) - 30ms
└── Order Service (SpanID: span4) - 40ms
```

### Metrics Collection
**Key metrics to monitor**:

**Service-Level Metrics**:
- Response time (95th percentile)
- Error rate
- Throughput (requests per second)
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory)

**Business Metrics**:
- Orders per minute
- Revenue per hour
- User conversion rates
- Feature adoption rates

### Centralized Logging
**Aggregate logs from all services**

**Log Structure**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "service": "user-service",
  "level": "INFO",
  "traceId": "abc123",
  "spanId": "span2",
  "message": "User login successful",
  "userId": "user-456"
}
```

## 🛠️ When to Use Microservices

### Good Candidates
**Situations where microservices excel**:

- **Large, complex applications** with multiple business domains
- **Multiple teams** working on different features
- **Different scalability requirements** for different components
- **Technology diversity** needed for optimal solutions
- **Frequent deployments** required for business agility

### Warning Signs
**When microservices might be overkill**:

- **Small team** (less than 10 developers)
- **Simple application** with limited complexity
- **Tight coupling** between business functions
- **Limited operational expertise** with distributed systems
- **Performance-critical** applications requiring minimal latency

## 🎯 Migration Strategies

### Strangler Fig Pattern
**Gradually replace monolith with microservices**

**Process**:
1. Identify service boundaries
2. Extract one service at a time
3. Route traffic to new service
4. Remove code from monolith
5. Repeat until monolith is gone

### Database Decomposition
**Separate shared databases**

**Steps**:
1. **Duplicate data** in new service database
2. **Synchronize** changes between old and new
3. **Switch reads** to new database
4. **Switch writes** to new database
5. **Remove old data** from monolith

### Feature Toggles
**Control feature rollout**

**Example**:
```javascript
if (featureToggle.isEnabled('new-checkout-service')) {
    return newCheckoutService.process(order);
} else {
    return legacyCheckout.process(order);
}
```

## 🚀 Best Practices

### Design Principles
1. **Design for failure**: Assume services will fail
2. **Embrace eventual consistency**: Perfect consistency is expensive
3. **Minimize service coupling**: Reduce dependencies between services
4. **Own your data**: Each service manages its own data
5. **Automate everything**: Deploy, monitor, and scale automatically

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Distributed monolith**: Services too tightly coupled
2. **Premature optimization**: Starting with microservices too early
3. **Ignoring data consistency**: Not handling eventual consistency
4. **Over-engineering**: Creating too many small services
5. **Neglecting monitoring**: Not investing in observability

### Success Factors
1. **Strong DevOps culture**: Automation and monitoring
2. **Clear service boundaries**: Well-defined responsibilities
3. **Skilled team**: Understanding of distributed systems
4. **Gradual migration**: Incremental approach to transformation
5. **Business alignment**: Services match business capabilities

Microservices architecture is powerful but complex. Success requires careful planning, skilled teams, and strong operational practices. Start simple, evolve gradually, and always align with business needs.

# System Design Fundamentals 🏗️

Master the core building blocks that power every scalable system — from simple web apps to platforms serving billions of users.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn Here

This section focuses purely on the essential concepts and principles that form the foundation of all system design. Think of this as your reference guide for the core knowledge needed to architect any system.

**🧠 Design Mindset** - How to think like a system architect  
**🏛️ Core Principles** - The 5 pillars that guide every design decision  
**📊 Quick Reference** - Essential patterns and decision frameworks  

!!! info "📋 New Organization: Everything in One Place"
    **All core system design topics are now organized under Fundamentals!** Instead of scattered navigation items, you'll find Scalability, Databases, Caching, Load Balancing, Networking, Messaging, and more as subsections here. This creates a logical learning path from basic concepts to advanced patterns.

## 🧠 The System Designer's Mindset

=== "🔍 Requirements First"

    **The Foundation of Great Design**
    
    Before writing a single line of code or drawing any architecture diagrams, deeply understand what you're building:
    
    **Functional Requirements** 📋
    
    - What features does the system need?
    - What are the core user workflows?
    - What business logic must be implemented?
    
    **Non-Functional Requirements** ⚡
    
    - **Scale**: How many users? (10K, 1M, 100M?)
    - **Performance**: Response time expectations (<100ms, <1s?)
    - **Availability**: Uptime requirements (99.9%, 99.99%?)
    - **Consistency**: How critical is data accuracy?
    
    **Constraints & Context** 🎯
    
    - Budget limitations and timeline
    - Team size and expertise
    - Existing technology stack
    - Regulatory/compliance requirements
    
    **Pro Tip**: Spend 20% of your design time clarifying requirements. It saves 80% of future headaches.

=== "⚡ Start Simple"

    **The KISS Principle in Action**
    
    Complex systems emerge from simple foundations. Start with the minimum viable architecture:
    
    **Phase 1: MVP Architecture** 🚀
    
    - Single server application
    - One database (probably PostgreSQL)
    - Basic monitoring and logging
    - Simple deployment process
    
    **Phase 2: Add Complexity When Needed** 📈
    
    - Database becomes bottleneck? → Add read replicas
    - Server overloaded? → Add load balancer + more servers
    - Slow queries? → Add caching layer
    - Team growing? → Consider microservices
    
    **Evolution Triggers** 🚨
    
    - Performance metrics drop below SLA
    - Team productivity decreases
    - System becomes unreliable
    - New business requirements can't be met
    
    **Remember**: Instagram served millions of users with a simple Django monolith for years. Don't over-engineer early.

=== "⚖️ Think Trade-offs"

    **Every Decision Has Consequences**
    
    There's no perfect architecture, only appropriate ones for your specific context:
    
    **Common Trade-offs** ⚖️
    - **Consistency vs Availability** (CAP Theorem)
      - Strong consistency: All nodes see same data instantly
      - High availability: System works even if some nodes fail
      - Pick based on business needs (banking vs social media)
    
    - **Performance vs Cost**
      - Faster systems cost more (better hardware, more servers)
      - Caching improves speed but adds complexity
      - CDNs reduce latency but increase operational overhead
    
    - **Simplicity vs Flexibility**
      - Monoliths are simple but harder to scale teams
      - Microservices are flexible but operationally complex
      - Choose based on team size and product maturity
    
    **Decision Framework** 📊
    1. Identify all viable options
    2. List pros/cons for each
    3. Weigh against your specific requirements
    4. Document your reasoning
    5. Plan migration path if needs change

=== "🔥 Plan for Failure"

    **Embrace the Chaos**
    
    Everything will fail eventually. Design systems that fail gracefully and recover quickly:
    
    **Types of Failures** 💥
    
    - **Hardware**: Servers crash, disks fail, networks partition
    - **Software**: Bugs, memory leaks, infinite loops
    - **External**: Third-party APIs down, DNS issues, DDoS attacks
    - **Human**: Deployment mistakes, configuration errors
    
    **Failure Mitigation Strategies** 🛡️
    
    - **Redundancy**: Multiple servers, database replicas
    - **Circuit Breakers**: Stop calling failing services
    - **Timeouts**: Don't wait forever for responses
    - **Retries with Backoff**: Try again, but intelligently
    - **Graceful Degradation**: Core features work when others fail
    
    **Recovery Planning** 🔄
    
    - **Monitoring**: Know when things break
    - **Alerting**: Wake someone when it matters
    - **Runbooks**: Step-by-step recovery procedures
    - **Backups**: Regular, tested data backups
    - **Rollback Plans**: Quick way to undo deployments
    
    **Testing Failures** 🧪
    
    - Chaos engineering (kill random services)
    - Load testing beyond normal capacity
    - Network partition simulations
    - Regular disaster recovery drills

**üìä Quick Reference** - Essential patterns and decision frameworks  

!!! info "üìã New Organization: Everything in One Place"
    **All core system design topics are now organized under Fundamentals!** Instead of scattered navigation items, you'll find Scalability, Databases, Caching, Load Balancing, Networking, Messaging, and more as subsections here. This creates a logical learning path from basic concepts to advanced patterns.

## üß† The System Designer's Mindset

=== "üîç Requirements First"

    **The Foundation of Great Design**
    
    Before writing a single line of code or drawing any architecture diagrams, deeply understand what you're building:
    
    **Functional Requirements** üìã
    
    - What features does the system need?
    - What are the core user workflows?
    - What business logic must be implemented?
    
    **Non-Functional Requirements** ‚ö°
    
    - **Scale**: How many users? (10K, 1M, 100M?)
    - **Performance**: Response time expectations (<100ms, <1s?)
    - **Availability**: Uptime requirements (99.9%, 99.99%?)
    - **Consistency**: How critical is data accuracy?
    
    **Constraints & Context** üéØ
    
    - Budget limitations and timeline
    - Team size and expertise
    - Existing technology stack
    - Regulatory/compliance requirements
    
    **Pro Tip**: Spend 20% of your design time clarifying requirements. It saves 80% of future headaches.

=== "‚ö° Start Simple"

    **The KISS Principle in Action**
    
    Complex systems emerge from simple foundations. Start with the minimum viable architecture:
    
    **Phase 1: MVP Architecture** üöÄ
    
    - Single server application
    - One database (probably PostgreSQL)
    - Basic monitoring and logging
    - Simple deployment process
    
    **Phase 2: Add Complexity When Needed** üìà
    
    - Database becomes bottleneck? ‚Üí Add read replicas
    - Server overloaded? ‚Üí Add load balancer + more servers
    - Slow queries? ‚Üí Add caching layer
    - Team growing? ‚Üí Consider microservices
    
    **Evolution Triggers** üö®
    
    - Performance metrics drop below SLA
    - Team productivity decreases
    - System becomes unreliable
    - New business requirements can't be met
    
    **Remember**: Instagram served millions of users with a simple Django monolith for years. Don't over-engineer early.

=== "‚öñÔ∏è Think Trade-offs"

    **Every Decision Has Consequences**
    
    There's no perfect architecture, only appropriate ones for your specific context:
    
    **Common Trade-offs** ‚öñÔ∏è
    - **Consistency vs Availability** (CAP Theorem)
      - Strong consistency: All nodes see same data instantly
      - High availability: System works even if some nodes fail
      - Pick based on business needs (banking vs social media)
    
    - **Performance vs Cost**
      - Faster systems cost more (better hardware, more servers)
      - Caching improves speed but adds complexity
      - CDNs reduce latency but increase operational overhead
    
    - **Simplicity vs Flexibility**
      - Monoliths are simple but harder to scale teams
      - Microservices are flexible but operationally complex
      - Choose based on team size and product maturity
    
    **Decision Framework** üìä
    1. Identify all viable options
    2. List pros/cons for each
    3. Weigh against your specific requirements
    4. Document your reasoning
    5. Plan migration path if needs change

=== "üî• Plan for Failure"

    **Embrace the Chaos**
    
    Everything will fail eventually. Design systems that fail gracefully and recover quickly:
    
    **Types of Failures** üí•
    
    - **Hardware**: Servers crash, disks fail, networks partition
    - **Software**: Bugs, memory leaks, infinite loops
    - **External**: Third-party APIs down, DNS issues, DDoS attacks
    - **Human**: Deployment mistakes, configuration errors
    
    **Failure Mitigation Strategies** üõ°Ô∏è
    
    - **Redundancy**: Multiple servers, database replicas
    - **Circuit Breakers**: Stop calling failing services
    - **Timeouts**: Don't wait forever for responses
    - **Retries with Backoff**: Try again, but intelligently
    - **Graceful Degradation**: Core features work when others fail
    
    **Recovery Planning** üîÑ
    
    - **Monitoring**: Know when things break
    - **Alerting**: Wake someone when it matters
    - **Runbooks**: Step-by-step recovery procedures
    - **Backups**: Regular, tested data backups
    - **Rollback Plans**: Quick way to undo deployments
    
    **Testing Failures** üß™
    
    - Chaos engineering (kill random services)
    - Load testing beyond normal capacity
    - Network partition simulations
    - Regular disaster recovery drills

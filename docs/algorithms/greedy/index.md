# Greedy Algorithms

## üéØ Overview

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. They're characterized by their simple, intuitive approach and often provide efficient solutions to optimization problems, though they don't always guarantee the optimal solution.

## üé® The Greedy Template

```python
def greedy_algorithm(problem_input):
    # Initialize solution
    solution = []
    
    # Sort or organize input based on greedy criteria
    candidates = sort_by_greedy_criteria(problem_input)
    
    # Make greedy choices
    for candidate in candidates:
        if is_feasible(candidate, solution):
            solution.append(candidate)
    
    return solution
```

## üß† Key Properties

### 1. **Greedy Choice Property**
- A globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making locally optimal choices
- Once a choice is made, it's never reconsidered

### 2. **Optimal Substructure**
- An optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems
- Similar to dynamic programming, but no overlapping subproblems

### 3. **No Backtracking**
- Decisions are final and irreversible
- Much simpler than backtracking approaches

## üèÜ Classic Greedy Problems

### **Activity Selection Problem**
```python
def activity_selection(activities):
    """
    Select maximum number of non-overlapping activities
    Greedy choice: Always pick activity that finishes earliest
    """
    # Sort by finish time
    activities.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    selected = [activities[0]]
    last_finish = activities[0][1]
    
    for start, finish in activities[1:]:
        if start >= last_finish:
            selected.append((start, finish))
            last_finish = finish
    
    return selected
```

### **Fractional Knapsack**
```python
def fractional_knapsack(capacity, items):
    """
    Maximize value with fractional items allowed
    Greedy choice: Pick items with highest value-to-weight ratio
    """
    # Sort by value-to-weight ratio (descending)
    items.sort(key=lambda x: x[1]/x[0], reverse=True)
    
    total_value = 0
    for weight, value in items:
        if capacity >= weight:
            # Take entire item
            total_value += value
            capacity -= weight
        else:
            # Take fraction of item
            total_value += value * (capacity / weight)
            break
    
    return total_value
```

### **Huffman Coding**
```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

def huffman_coding(text):
    """
    Build optimal prefix-free code
    Greedy choice: Always merge two least frequent nodes
    """
    # Count frequencies
    freq = Counter(text)
    
    # Create priority queue
    heap = [[freq[char], char] for char in freq]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    
    # Build Huffman tree
    while len(heap) > 1:
        left = heapq.heappop(heap)
        right = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        # Create internal node
        merged = [left[0] + right[0], left, right]
        heapq.heappush(heap, merged)
    
    # Build code table
    codes = {}
    def build_codes(node, code=""):
        if isinstance(node[1], str):  # Leaf node
            codes[node[1]] = code or "0"
        else:  # Internal node
            build_codes(node[1], code + "0")
            build_codes(node[2], code + "1")
    
    build_codes(heap[0])
    return codes
```

## üìä Common Greedy Strategies

### **1. Sort-Based Greedy**
```python
def job_scheduling(jobs):
    """Sort jobs by deadline, then by profit"""
    jobs.sort(key=lambda x: (x.deadline, -x.profit))
    # Apply greedy selection...
```

### **2. Priority-Based Greedy**
```python
def dijkstra_shortest_path(graph, start):
    """Always select unvisited node with minimum distance"""
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]
    
    while pq:
        current_dist, current = heapq.heappop(pq)
        # Greedy choice: process nearest unvisited node
```

### **3. Exchange-Based Greedy**
```python
def coin_change_greedy(amount, coins):
    """Use largest denomination first (only works for certain coin systems)"""
    coins.sort(reverse=True)
    result = []
    
    for coin in coins:
        while amount >= coin:
            result.append(coin)
            amount -= coin
    
    return result if amount == 0 else None
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è When Greedy Fails

### **Coin Change Problem**
```python
# Greedy fails with coins = [1, 3, 4] and amount = 6
# Greedy: 4 + 1 + 1 = 3 coins
# Optimal: 3 + 3 = 2 coins

def coin_change_dp(amount, coins):
    """Dynamic programming solution for optimal coin change"""
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if coin <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

### **0/1 Knapsack Problem**
```python
# Greedy by value-to-weight ratio doesn't work
# Need dynamic programming for optimal solution

def knapsack_01_dp(capacity, weights, values):
    """Dynamic programming solution for 0/1 knapsack"""
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(capacity + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(
                    values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]],
                    dp[i-1][w]
                )
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
    
    return dp[n][capacity]
```

## üîç Proving Greedy Correctness

### **Method 1: Exchange Argument**
1. Assume optimal solution differs from greedy
2. Show we can exchange choices to match greedy
3. Prove exchange doesn't worsen the solution

### **Method 2: Greedy Stays Ahead**
1. Show greedy solution is always "ahead" of any other solution
2. Prove this lead is maintained at each step

### **Method 3: Contradiction**
1. Assume greedy doesn't produce optimal solution
2. Derive contradiction from this assumption

## üìà Complexity Analysis

### **Time Complexity Patterns**
- **Sorting-based**: Usually O(n log n) due to sorting
- **Priority queue**: O(n log n) for heap operations
- **Linear scan**: O(n) for simple greedy choices

### **Space Complexity**
- Often O(1) extra space beyond input
- Sometimes O(n) for auxiliary data structures

## üéØ Problem Recognition

### **Use Greedy When:**
- Local optimal choices lead to global optimum
- Problem has optimal substructure
- No need to reconsider previous decisions
- Simple, intuitive solution exists

### **Don't Use Greedy When:**
- Multiple factors need simultaneous optimization

- Optimal substructure doesn't hold

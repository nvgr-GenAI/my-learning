# Dynamic Programming Documentation

## Structure Overview

This directory contains documentation for various Dynamic Programming patterns organized into individual files for better readability and maintainability.

### Main Files

- `patterns.md` - High-level overview of all DP patterns with links to detailed files
- `fundamentals.md` - Core concepts and approaches for dynamic programming
- `index.md` - Entry point with problem collections by difficulty

### Pattern-Specific Files

Each pattern has its own detailed file with a consistent structure:

1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of the pattern
2. **Overview Tab**: Core idea, when to use, recurrence relation, and real-world applications
3. **Example Problems Tab**: Common problems that use this pattern with explanations
4. **Visualization Tab**: Visual representations of how the pattern works
5. **Implementation Tab**: Code implementations from naive to optimized
6. **Tips and Insights Tab**: Advanced techniques and things to watch for

### Current Status

- ✅ High-level overview structure in `patterns.md`
- ✅ Detailed pattern files for:
  - Fibonacci Pattern
  - Longest Increasing Subsequence Pattern
- ⏳ In progress:
  - Other pattern files

## To-Do List

- Create detailed files for remaining patterns:
  - [x] Fibonacci (`fibonacci.md`) 
  - [x] Longest Increasing Subsequence (`lis.md`)
  - [ ] Longest Common Subsequence (`lcs.md`) - Update to new format
  - [ ] Edit Distance (`edit-distance.md`) - Update to new format
  - [ ] Unique Paths (`unique-paths.md`)
  - [ ] Min/Max Path Sum (`min-max-path-sum.md`)
  - [ ] Knapsack (`knapsack.md`) - Update to new format
  - [ ] Unbounded Knapsack (`unbounded-knapsack.md`)
  - [ ] Multi-dimensional Knapsack (`multi-dimensional-knapsack.md`)
  - [ ] Matrix Chain (`matrix-chain.md`)
  - [ ] Palindrome Partitioning (`palindrome-partitioning.md`)
  - [ ] Optimal Triangulation (`optimal-triangulation.md`)
  - [ ] Buy/Sell Stock (`buy-sell-stock.md`)
  - [ ] Game Theory (`game-theory.md`)
  - [ ] State Transition (`state-transition.md`)
  - [ ] FSM (`fsm.md`)
  - [ ] Subset State (`subset-state.md`)
  - [ ] State Compression (`state-compression.md`)
  - [ ] Submask Enumeration (`submask-enumeration.md`)
  - [ ] Expected Value (`expected-value.md`)
  - [ ] Markov Chain (`markov-chain.md`)
  - [ ] Palindrome (`palindrome.md`)
  - [ ] String Matching (`string-matching.md`)
  - [ ] String Transformation (`string-transformation.md`)

- Update existing files to use the tabbed approach
- Add consistent cross-references between related patterns
- Add more visualizations for complex patterns
- Include interactive examples where possible

## Style Guidelines

- Use markdown tabs with `=== "Tab Name"` syntax
- Include visualizations for key concepts
- Provide both naive and optimized implementations
- Use consistent formatting and structure across all files
- Include real-world applications to demonstrate practical relevance

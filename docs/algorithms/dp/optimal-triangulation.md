# Optimal Triangulation Pattern

## Introduction

The Optimal Triangulation pattern is an interval dynamic programming pattern that deals with finding the optimal way to triangulate polygons or divide a sequence by adding internal connections. This pattern is particularly useful in computational geometry, graphics, and optimization problems.

=== "Overview"
    **Core Idea**: Find the optimal way to triangulate a polygon or divide a sequence by adding internal connections.
    
    **When to Use**:
    
    - When dividing a polygon into triangles
    - When optimizing hierarchical structures
    - When the cost function depends on non-adjacent elements
    - When solving problems related to polygon decomposition
    - When dealing with computational geometry optimization
    
    **Recurrence Relation**: `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + cost(i,j,k))` for all i < k < j
    
    **Real-World Applications**:
    
    - 3D graphics mesh generation
    - Computational geometry for CAD/CAM systems
    - Database query optimization
    - Optimal decision tree construction
    - Hierarchical data visualization

=== "Example Problems"
    - **Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon**: Triangulate a convex polygon to minimize the score
      - Problem: For a polygon with vertices 0 to n-1, find triangulation with minimum score
      - Score: Sum of products of values at the three vertices forming each triangle
      - Example: Values [1,2,3] → Triangulation score: 1×2×3 = 6
    
    - **Optimal Binary Search Tree**: Construct a BST with minimum expected search cost
      - Problem: Given keys and their frequencies, arrange them to minimize total search cost
      - Cost: Weighted path length from root to each node
      - Application: Optimizing decision trees for databases
    
    - **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: Find the most efficient way to multiply matrices
      - Problem: Given dimensions of matrices, find order that minimizes scalar multiplications
      - Shows how triangulation pattern applies to non-geometric problems
    
    - **Optimal Polygon Triangulation**: Triangulate a polygon to minimize the sum of triangle perimeters
      - Variation: Different cost functions for triangulation
      - Application: Mesh generation for graphics and simulation

=== "Visualization"
    For Minimum Score Triangulation with values [3, 7, 4, 5]:
    
    ```text
    Consider a square with vertices labeled clockwise: 0(3), 1(7), 2(4), 3(5)
    
    dp[i][j] = minimum triangulation score for vertices i to j
    
    dp table:
    
         | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
    -----|---|---|---|---|
      0  | 0 |140| 84|120|
    -----|---|---|---|---|
      1  | - | 0 |140| 55|
    -----|---|---|---|---|
      2  | - | - | 0 | 20|
    -----|---|---|---|---|
      3  | - | - | - | 0 |
    
    The minimum triangulation score is 120 (top-right cell).
    
    One optimal triangulation: 
    - Triangle (0,1,3): 3×7×5 = 105
    - Triangle (1,2,3): 7×4×5 = 140
    - Total: 105 + 140 = 245
    ```

=== "Implementation"
    **Minimum Score Triangulation**:
    
    ```python
    def min_score_triangulation(values):
        n = len(values)
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Iterate over all possible lengths of intervals
        for length in range(2, n):
            for i in range(n - length):
                j = i + length
                dp[i][j] = float('inf')
                # Try each vertex k as the third point of a triangle
                for k in range(i + 1, j):
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], 
                                   dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i] * values[k] * values[j])
        
        return dp[0][n-1]
    ```
    
    **Optimal Binary Search Tree**:
    
    ```python
    def optimal_bst(keys, freq):
        n = len(keys)
        # dp[i][j] = optimal cost of BST containing keys i to j
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Initialize for single keys (length 1 sequences)
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = freq[i]
        
        # Compute prefix sums for efficient sum calculation
        prefix_sum = [0]
        for f in freq:
            prefix_sum.append(prefix_sum[-1] + f)
        
        # Build up by length of interval
        for length in range(2, n + 1):
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1
                dp[i][j] = float('inf')
                
                # Try each key as root
                for r in range(i, j + 1):
                    left = dp[i][r-1] if r > i else 0
                    right = dp[r+1][j] if r < j else 0
                    
                    # Cost = left subtree + right subtree + sum of frequencies
                    cost = left + right + (prefix_sum[j+1] - prefix_sum[i])
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], cost)
        
        return dp[0][n-1]
    ```
    
    **General Triangulation Framework**:
    
    ```python
    def triangulate(points, cost_function):
        n = len(points)
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        for length in range(2, n):
            for i in range(n - length):
                j = i + length
                dp[i][j] = float('inf')
                
                for k in range(i + 1, j):
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], 
                                  dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + cost_function(points[i], points[k], points[j]))
        
        return dp[0][n-1]
    ```

=== "Tips and Insights"
    - **Problem Representation**: 
      - For polygons, vertices are typically numbered 0 to n-1 clockwise
      - For other problems, conceptualize the elements as forming a sequence
    - **State Definition**: `dp[i][j]` represents the optimal cost for the subproblem from i to j
    - **Base Cases**:
      - `dp[i][i] = 0` (no triangulation needed for a single point)
      - `dp[i][i+1] = 0` (no triangulation needed for just two points)
    - **Recurrence Structure**:
      - Always involves trying each possible "split point" k between i and j
      - Cost typically involves combining solutions to subproblems plus some additional cost
    - **Order of Computation**:
      - Always process smaller intervals before larger ones
      - Typically done by increasing the interval length
    - **Optimization Opportunities**:
      - Precomputing costs or sums can speed up computation
      - For some geometric problems, exploiting properties of convex/concave functions
    - **Time Complexity**: 
      - Typically O(n³) due to the three nested loops
      - Some special cases can be optimized to O(n²)
    - **Space Complexity**: 
      - Generally O(n²) for the DP table
    - **Related Techniques**:
      - Knuth's optimization for certain cost functions
      - Convex hull optimization for special cases
    - **Practical Considerations**:
      - For large n, consider approximation algorithms
      - Numerical stability can be an issue for some cost functions
    - **Debugging Tips**:
      - Visualize the triangulation for small examples
      - Check base cases and boundary conditions carefully

## Pattern Recognition

The Optimal Triangulation pattern appears when:

1. **Partitioning problems** with non-adjacent connections
2. **Geometric decomposition** of polygons or shapes
3. **Hierarchical structure optimization** (like trees)
4. **Problems with cost functions** that depend on three or more points

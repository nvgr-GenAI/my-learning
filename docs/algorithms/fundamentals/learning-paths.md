    > "The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it." - Dennis Ritchie

    Remember that **consistency trumps intensity**. A daily habit of solving even one problem will yield better results than occasional cramming sessions. Apply what you learn to real-world problems whenever possible, and don't hesitate to revisit fundamentals regularly.

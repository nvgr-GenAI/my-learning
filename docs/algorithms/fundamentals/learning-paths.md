## 📊 Practice Strategy

=== "Problem Selection"
    **Progression Framework:**

    | Stage | Problem Type | Success Rate | What to Do |
    |-------|--------------|--------------|------------|
    | **Building** | Easy | < 70% | Focus on fundamentals, slow down |
    | **Practicing** | Medium | 50-70% | Perfect stage - challenging but achievable |
    | **Mastering** | Hard | 30-50% | Push boundaries, learn new techniques |
    | **Too Hard** | Any | < 30% | Step back, fill knowledge gaps |

    **Quality over Quantity:** Better to solve 100 problems deeply than 300 superficially

=== "Study Techniques"
    | Technique | How to Apply | Benefit |
    |-----------|--------------|---------|
    | **Spaced Repetition** | Revisit problems after 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month | Long-term retention |
    | **Active Recall** | Code from memory without looking | Strengthen understanding |
    | **Elaboration** | Explain solution out loud or in writing | Deepen comprehension |
    | **Interleaving** | Mix problem types instead of blocking | Pattern recognition |
    | **Mock Interviews** | Simulate real interview pressure | Communication skills |

=== "When You're Stuck"
    **Struggle Threshold:** Spend 25-30 minutes before looking at hints

    **Progressive Help:**
    1. Read problem again carefully (missed constraint?)
    2. Draw examples on paper (see pattern?)
    3. Consider brute force first (optimize later)
    4. Look at hint (not full solution)
    5. Study solution, understand why it works
    6. Implement from memory next day

## 💡 Success Principles

!!! success "Keys to Mastery"
    1. **Consistency > Intensity** - 1 hour daily beats 8 hours on weekends
    2. **Understanding > Memorization** - Know why, not just how
    3. **Patterns > Problems** - Recognize categories, not individual solutions
    4. **Quality > Quantity** - 10 problems deeply > 50 problems superficially
    5. **Communication** - Practice explaining your thought process aloud

!!! warning "Common Mistakes to Avoid"
    - Jumping to hard problems too quickly
    - Looking at solutions immediately when stuck
    - Not reviewing problems after solving
    - Ignoring complexity analysis
    - Practicing only one type of problem

!!! quote "Remember"
    > "The only way to learn algorithms is by solving problems." — Donald Knuth (paraphrased)

    Progress isn't linear. Plateaus are normal. Persistence and consistent practice will get you there.

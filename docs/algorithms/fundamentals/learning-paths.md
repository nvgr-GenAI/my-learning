=== "📊 Practice Strategies"

    ## Problem Selection Framework

    ### Difficulty Progression

    **Follow the 70% rule:** You should be solving ~70% of problems at your current level.

    | Success Rate | Action | What It Means |
    |--------------|--------|---------------|
    | **< 50%** | Step back to easier problems | Too difficult, hurting confidence |
    | **50-70%** | Perfect! Stay at this level | Optimal learning zone |
    | **70-85%** | Mix in harder problems | Ready to level up |
    | **> 85%** | Move to next difficulty | Too easy, wasting time |

    ### Study Techniques

    === "Spaced Repetition"

        **Proven method for long-term retention**

        | Review | After Initial Solve | What to Do |
        |--------|---------------------|------------|
        | **1st** | +1 day | Solve again from memory |
        | **2nd** | +3 days | Solve similar problem |
        | **3rd** | +1 week | Explain solution aloud |
        | **4th** | +2 weeks | Solve harder variant |
        | **5th** | +1 month | Teach someone else |

        **Tool:** Anki flashcards, spreadsheet tracker

    === "Active Recall"

        **Force your brain to retrieve information**

        **Instead of:**
        - Re-reading code
        - Looking at solution again
        - Copying and pasting

        **Do:**
        - Code from memory (blank screen)
        - Explain to rubber duck
        - Draw solution on paper first

    === "Deliberate Practice"

        **Focus on weaknesses, not strengths**

        ```
        1. Identify weak area (e.g., DP, graph algorithms)
        2. Study theory (1-2 hours)
        3. Solve 5-10 problems in that area
        4. Review mistakes deeply
        5. Re-test in 1 week
        ```

        **Example:** Struggled with DP?
        - Day 1: Study DP patterns (2h)
        - Day 2-6: Solve 10 DP problems (1-2h daily)
        - Day 7: Mock interview with DP problems
        - Day 14: Revisit same 10 problems

    === "Interleaving"

        **Mix problem types instead of blocking**

        **Blocked Practice** (less effective):
        ```
        Day 1-3: Only array problems (10 problems)
        Day 4-6: Only tree problems (10 problems)
        Day 7-9: Only DP problems (10 problems)
        ```

        **Interleaved Practice** (more effective):
        ```
        Day 1: 1 array + 1 tree + 1 DP
        Day 2: 1 tree + 1 DP + 1 graph
        Day 3: 1 DP + 1 array + 1 tree
        ...
        ```

        **Why:** Forces pattern recognition, mimics real interviews

    ---

    ## When You're Stuck

    ### The 30-Minute Rule

    ```
    0-10 min: Understand problem, try brute force
    10-20 min: Consider patterns, optimize approach
    20-30 min: Start implementation or seek hint
    30+ min: Look at hint (not full solution)
    ```

    ### Progressive Help System

    | Level | What to Use | When |
    |-------|-------------|------|
    | **Hint 1** | Re-read constraints | After 5 min |
    | **Hint 2** | Draw examples, look for pattern | After 15 min |
    | **Hint 3** | Google "[pattern] + problem type" | After 25 min |
    | **Hint 4** | Read approach (not code) | After 30 min |
    | **Solution** | Study editorial with code | After honest attempt |

    ### After Viewing Solution

    **Don't just move on! Follow up:**

    1. Close the solution
    2. Implement from memory (same day)
    3. Solve again next day (no peeking)
    4. Find similar problem, solve independently
    5. Add to spaced repetition schedule

        - Practice: 12 DP problems
        - Mock: 1 interview (DP focus)
        ```

    === "Monthly Assessment"

        **Self-quiz:**
        - Can you solve LeetCode medium in 30-40 min?
        - Do you recognize 15+ patterns immediately?
        - Can you explain Big O without hesitation?
        - Are you comfortable in mock interviews?

## 💡 Success Principles

**The 5 Keys to Mastery:**

| Principle | Why It Matters | How to Apply |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **1. Consistency > Intensity** | Brain needs regular exposure | 1 hour daily beats 8 hours once/week |
| **2. Understanding > Memorization** | Adapt to new problems | Ask "why" not just "how" |
| **3. Patterns > Problems** | Solve categories, not singles | Focus on 20 patterns, not 200 problems |
| **4. Quality > Quantity** | Deep learning sticks | 10 problems deeply > 50 superficially |
| **5. Communication** | Interviews test process | Always explain your thinking |

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| ❌ Jumping to hard too fast | Frustration, burnout | Follow 70% success rule |
| ❌ Looking at solution immediately | No learning | 30-minute honest attempt first |
| ❌ Not reviewing solved problems | Forgetting | Spaced repetition schedule |
| ❌ Ignoring complexity | Incomplete understanding | Analyze every solution |
| ❌ Practicing only one category | Pattern blindness | Interleave problem types |
| ❌ Solo grinding only | Missing communication | Do mock interviews |

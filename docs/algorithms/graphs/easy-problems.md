## Problem 1: Number of Islands

**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¢ Easy  
**Pattern**: DFS/BFS on Grid  
**Time**: O(mÃ—n), **Space**: O(mÃ—n)

=== "Problem Statement"

    Given a 2D binary grid representing a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

    **Example:**
    ```text
    Input: grid = [
      ["1","1","1","1","0"],
      ["1","1","0","1","0"],
      ["1","1","0","0","0"], 
      ["0","0","0","0","0"]
    ]
    Output: 1
    ```

=== "DFS Solution"

    ```python
    def numIslands(grid):
        """
        DFS approach - explore each island completely when found.
        Time: O(mÃ—n), Space: O(mÃ—n) for recursion stack
        """
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return 0
        
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        islands = 0
        
        def dfs(r, c):
            # Base cases: out of bounds or water/visited
            if (r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or grid[r][c] != '1'):
                return
            
            # Mark as visited by setting to '0'
            grid[r][c] = '0'
            
            # Explore all 4 directions
            dfs(r + 1, c)  # Down
            dfs(r - 1, c)  # Up
            dfs(r, c + 1)  # Right
            dfs(r, c - 1)  # Left
        
        # Check each cell
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == '1':
                    islands += 1
                    dfs(r, c)  # Sink the entire island
        
        return islands
    ```

=== "BFS Solution"

    ```python
    def numIslands(grid):
        """
        BFS approach - explore islands level by level.

        """
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return 0
        
        from collections import deque
        
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        islands = 0
        
        def bfs(start_r, start_c):
            queue = deque([(start_r, start_c)])
            grid[start_r][start_c] = '0'  # Mark as visited

                for dr, dc in directions:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    
                    if (0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == '1'):
                        grid[nr][nc] = '0'  # Mark as visited
                        queue.append((nr, nc))
        
        # Check each cell
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == '1':
                    islands += 1
                    bfs(r, c)  # Explore the entire island
        
        return islands
    ```

=== "ðŸ’¡ Tips & Insights"

    **Key Insights:**
    
    - Grid problems are graphs in disguise - each cell is a node
    - Mark visited cells to avoid infinite loops and recounting
    - DFS uses recursion stack, BFS uses explicit queue
    - Both approaches modify the grid - make a copy if needed
    
    **Interview Notes:**
    
    - Ask about modifying input vs using visited set
    - Clarify connectivity (4-directional vs 8-directional)
    - Consider edge cases: empty grid, single cell
    - Time complexity is always O(mÃ—n) - visit each cell once

## Problem 2: Find if Path Exists

**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¢ Easy  
**Pattern**: Graph Traversal  
**Time**: O(V+E), **Space**: O(V+E)

=== "Problem Statement"

    Given a graph represented by edges and two nodes `source` and `destination`, determine if there exists a valid path from `source` to `destination`.

    **Example:**

        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
        
        visited = set()
        
        def dfs(node):

                    queue.append(neighbor)
        
        return False
    ```

        """
        Union-Find approach for connectivity queries.
        Time: O(EÃ—Î±(n)), Space: O(n)
        """
        if source == destination:

        parent = list(range(n))
        rank = [0] * n
        
        def find(x):
            if parent[x] != x:
                parent[x] = find(parent[x])  # Path compression
            return parent[x]
        
        def union(x, y):

    ```

=== "ðŸ’¡ Tips & Insights"

    **Key Insights:**
    
    - Three main approaches: DFS, BFS, Union-Find
    - DFS/BFS: Good for single query, O(V+E) time
    - Union-Find: Better for multiple connectivity queries
    - Early termination when destination found
    
    **Interview Notes:**
    
    - Ask about graph representation (adjacency list vs matrix)
    - Consider number of queries - Union-Find for multiple
    - Edge case: source equals destination
    - Space-time tradeoffs between approaches

## Problem 3: Clone Graph

**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¢ Easy  
**Pattern**: DFS/BFS with Cloning  
**Time**: O(V+E), **Space**: O(V)

=== "Problem Statement"

    Given a reference to a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node contains a value and a list of neighbors.

    **Example:**
    ```text
    Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
    Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
    ```

        clones = {}  # Original node -> Cloned node mapping
        
        def dfs(original):
            if original in clones:
                return clones[original]
            
            # Create clone for current node
            clone = Node(original.val)
            clones[original] = clone
            
            # Clone all neighbors
            for neighbor in original.neighbors:
                clone.neighbors.append(dfs(neighbor))
            
            return clone

                    clones[neighbor] = Node(neighbor.val)
                    queue.append(neighbor)
                
                # Connect clone to neighbor clone
                clones[original].neighbors.append(clones[neighbor])
        
        return clones[node]
    ```

=== "ðŸ’¡ Tips & Insights"

    **Key Insights:**
    
    - Use hashmap to track original -> clone mapping

## Problem 4: All Paths Source to Target

**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¢ Easy  
**Pattern**: DFS Backtracking  
**Time**: O(2^V Ã— V), **Space**: O(V)

=== "Problem Statement"

    Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1, find all possible paths from node 0 to node n-1.

    **Example:**
    ```text
    Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
    Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
    ```

=== "DFS Backtracking"

        """
        DFS backtracking to find all paths.
        Time: O(2^V Ã— V), Space: O(V) for recursion

        target = len(graph) - 1
        result = []
        
        def dfs(node, path):
            if node == target:
                result.append(path[:])  # Add copy of current path
                return
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                path.append(neighbor)
                dfs(neighbor, path)
                path.pop()  # Backtrack
        
        dfs(0, [0])

    def allPathsSourceTarget(graph):
        """
        Iterative DFS using stack.
        Time: O(2^V Ã— V), Space: O(2^V Ã— V)
        """
        target = len(graph) - 1
        stack = [(0, [0])]  # (current_node, current_path)
        result = []
        
        while stack:
            node, path = stack.pop()
            
            if node == target:
                result.append(path)
                continue
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                stack.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
        
        return result
    ```

=== "ðŸ’¡ Tips & Insights"

    **Key Insights:**
    
    - DAG property ensures no cycles - no visited set needed
    - Backtracking naturally explores all possible paths
    - Path copying is crucial for correct results
    - Exponential time complexity due to potentially many paths
    
    **Interview Notes:**
    
    - Confirm graph is DAG (no cycle handling needed)
    - Ask about memory constraints for large path counts
    - Consider iterative vs recursive based on stack depth
    - Time complexity depends on number of possible paths

## Problem 5: Find Center of Star Graph

**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¢ Easy  
**Pattern**: Graph Properties  
**Time**: O(1), **Space**: O(1)

=== "Problem Statement"

    There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n-1 edges that connect the center node with every other node.

    **Example:**
    ```text
    Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Node 2 is connected to every other node.
    ```

=== "Optimal Solution"

    ```python
    def findCenter(edges):
        """
        In a star graph, center appears in every edge.
        Check first two edges to find common node.
        Time: O(1), Space: O(1)
        """
        # The center must be in both first and second edge
        first_edge = edges[0]
        second_edge = edges[1]
        
        # Find common node between first two edges
        if first_edge[0] in second_edge:
            return first_edge[0]
        else:
            return first_edge[1]
    ```

=== "Degree Counting"

    ```python
    def findCenter(edges):
        """
        Alternative: Count degrees (less efficient but shows concept).
        Time: O(E), Space: O(V)
        """
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        degree = defaultdict(int)
        
        for u, v in edges:
            degree[u] += 1
            degree[v] += 1
        
        # Find node with maximum degree
        return max(degree, key=degree.get)
    ```

=== "ðŸ’¡ Tips & Insights"

    **Key Insights:**
    
    - Star graph property: center connected to all other nodes
    - Center appears in every edge of the graph
    - Only need to check first two edges for common node
    - Degree of center = n-1, others = 1
    
    **Interview Notes:**
    
    - Leverage star graph properties for O(1) solution
    - Ask if graph is guaranteed to be a star
    - Consider edge cases: minimum star has 2 nodes
    - Optimal solution beats brute force by orders of magnitude

## Problem 6: Find Town Judge

**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¢ Easy  
**Pattern**: In/Out Degree Analysis  
**Time**: O(V+E), **Space**: O(V)

=== "Problem Statement"

    In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge. The town judge:
    1. Trusts nobody
    2. Is trusted by everyone else

    **Example:**
    ```text
    Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: Person 3 is trusted by 1 and 2, and trusts nobody.
    ```

=== "Degree Counting"

    ```python

    - Path compression optimizes Union-Find performance
    
    **Interview Notes:**
    
    - Ask if edges are processed in specific order
    - Consider Union-Find vs DFS tradeoffs
    - Clarify if solution should be lexicographically smallest
    - Union-Find preferred for this specific problem pattern

=== "ðŸ’¡ Tips & Insights"

    **Key Insights:**
    
    - Course scheduling âŸº cycle detection in directed graph
    - DFS: Use 3-state coloring to detect back edges
    - BFS (Kahn's): Process nodes with zero in-degree iteratively
    - If cycle exists, impossible to complete all courses
    
    **Interview Notes:**
    
    - Ask about self-loops and duplicate prerequisites
    - Two main approaches: DFS cycle detection vs topological sort
    - Kahn's algorithm also produces valid course order
    - Consider follow-up: return actual course schedule

## Problem 12: Minimum Height Trees

**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¢ Easy  
**Pattern**: Tree Properties (Leaf Removal)  
**Time**: O(V), **Space**: O(V)

=== "Problem Statement"

    For an undirected graph that forms a tree, find all nodes that can serve as root to create minimum height trees. At most 2 such nodes exist.

    **Example:**
    ```text
    Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]
    Output: [1]
    Explanation: Root at node 1 gives height 1.
    ```

    ```

=== "ðŸ’¡ Tips & Insights"

    **Key Insights:**
    
    - Tree centroid property: at most 2 nodes minimize max distance
    - Remove leaves iteratively - they can't be optimal roots
    - Last 1-2 remaining nodes are the centroids
    - Linear time algorithm using BFS-like level processing
    
    **Interview Notes:**
    
    - Ask about tree guarantee (connected, n-1 edges)
    - Consider edge cases: n=1, n=2 (special handling)
    - Explain centroid property and why it works
    - Alternative: brute force has O(VÂ²) complexity

## Problem 13: Employee Importance

**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¢ Easy  
**Pattern**: DFS/BFS  
**Time**: O(V+E), **Space**: O(V)

=== "Problem Statement"

    You have employees with unique IDs and importance values. Each employee has subordinates. Given an employee ID, calculate total importance of the employee and all subordinates.

    **Example:**
    ```text
    Input: employees = [[1,5,[2,3]],[2,3,[]],[3,3,[]]], id = 1
    Output: 11
    Explanation: Employee 1 has importance 5, and subordinates 2,3 with importance 3 each.
    ```

=== "DFS Solution"

                queue.append(sub_id)
        
        return total
    ```

=== "ðŸ’¡ Tips & Insights"

    **Key Insights:**
    
    - Tree/DAG traversal problem in disguise
    - Build lookup map for O(1) employee access
    - Both DFS and BFS work - DFS more natural for hierarchy
    - No cycle detection needed (organizational hierarchy)
    
    **Interview Notes:**
    
    - Ask about data structure format and constraints
    - Consider memory usage for large organizations
    - Clarify if cycles possible (unusual but worth asking)
    - Preprocessing with map improves lookup efficiency

## Problem 14: Keys and Rooms

**Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¢ Easy  
**Pattern**: DFS/BFS  
**Time**: O(V+E), **Space**: O(V)

=== "Problem Statement"

    There are n rooms numbered 0 to n-1. Room 0 is unlocked initially. Each room contains keys to other rooms. Determine if you can visit all rooms.

    **Example:**
    ```text
    Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
    Output: true
    Explanation: Start in room 0, get key to room 1, then 2, then 3.
    ```

=== "DFS Solution"

    - Graph reachability problem - can reach all nodes from node 0
    - Rooms are nodes, keys are directed edges
    - Standard DFS/BFS traversal with visited tracking
    - Count visited rooms and compare with total

    - Ask about room numbering (0-indexed, consecutive)
    - Consider duplicate keys (doesn't affect algorithm)
    - All three approaches (DFS, BFS, iterative) work equally well
    - Edge case: single room (always true)

    - Check if new color equals original to avoid infinite loops
    - Both DFS and BFS work - DFS more memory efficient
    - 4-directional connectivity (not 8-directional)
    
    **Interview Notes:**
    
    - Ask about in-place modification vs creating new image
    - Clarify connectivity type (4-way vs 8-way)
    - Consider edge case: new color equals original color
    - Time complexity always O(mÃ—n) in worst case

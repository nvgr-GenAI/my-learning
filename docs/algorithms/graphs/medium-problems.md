## Problem 1: Course Schedule

=== "Problem Statement"
    **Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
    **Pattern**: Topological Sort / Cycle Detection  
    **Time**: O(V+E), **Space**: O(V+E)

    There are `numCourses` courses labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

    Return `true` if you can finish all courses, otherwise return `false`.

    **Example:**
    ```
    Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
    Output: true
    Explanation: Take course 0, then course 1.

    Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
    Output: false
    Explanation: Circular dependency.
    ```

=== "Solution"

    def canFinish(numCourses, prerequisites):
        """
        Detect cycle in directed graph using DFS
        - WHITE: not visited

        - BLACK: visited (processed)
        """
        # Build adjacency list
        graph = {i: [] for i in range(numCourses)}
        for course, prereq in prerequisites:
            graph[prereq].append(course)
        
        # Color states: 0=white, 1=gray, 2=black
        color = [0] * numCourses
        
        def has_cycle(node):
            if color[node] == 1:  # Gray - cycle detected
                return True
            if color[node] == 2:  # Black - already processed
                return False
            
            # Mark as gray (visiting)
            color[node] = 1
            
            # Visit all neighbors
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if has_cycle(neighbor):
                    return True
            
            # Mark as black (processed)
            color[node] = 2
            return False
        
        # Check each component
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if color[i] == 0 and has_cycle(i):
                return False
        
        return True
    ```

=== "Alternative Solutions"
    **Kahn's Algorithm (BFS Topological Sort):**
    ```python
    def canFinish(numCourses, prerequisites):
        from collections import deque, defaultdict
        
        # Build graph and indegree
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        indegree = [0] * numCourses
        
        for course, prereq in prerequisites:
            graph[prereq].append(course)
            indegree[course] += 1
        
        # BFS with nodes having indegree 0
        queue = deque([i for i in range(numCourses) if indegree[i] == 0])
        processed = 0
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            processed += 1
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                indegree[neighbor] -= 1
                if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        
        return processed == numCourses
    ```

=== "Tips & Insights"
    **Pattern Recognition:**
    - Prerequisite problems â†’ Topological sort
    - Cycle detection needed â†’ Use DFS with coloring or BFS with indegree
    - Directed graph problems often need state tracking

    **Common Mistakes:**
    - Forgetting to handle disconnected components
    - Mixing up course and prerequisite order
    - Not properly resetting visited states

    **Interview Tips:**
    - Explain both DFS and BFS approaches
    - Discuss time/space complexity trade-offs
    - Mention real-world applications (build systems, academic planning)

## Problem 2: Shortest Path in Binary Matrix

=== "Problem Statement"
    **Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
    **Pattern**: BFS / Shortest Path  
    **Time**: O(NÂ²), **Space**: O(NÂ²)

    Given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid`, return the length of the shortest clear path from top-left to bottom-right. If no such path exists, return `-1`.

    A clear path is a path from `(0, 0)` to `(n-1, n-1)` where all visited cells are `0`. You can move 8-directionally.

    **Example:**
    ```
    Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Path is (0,0)â†’(0,1)â†’(0,2)â†’(1,2)â†’(2,2)
    ```

=== "Solution"
    ```python
    def shortestPathBinaryMatrix(grid):
        from collections import deque
        
        n = len(grid)
        if grid[0][0] == 1 or grid[n-1][n-1] == 1:
            return -1
        
        # 8 directions
        directions = [(-1,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,-1),(0,1),(1,-1),(1,0),(1,1)]
        
        queue = deque([(0, 0, 1)])  # (row, col, path_length)
        visited = {(0, 0)}
        
        while queue:
            row, col, path_len = queue.popleft()
            
            if row == n-1 and col == n-1:
                return path_len
            
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and 
                    grid[nr][nc] == 0 and (nr, nc) not in visited):
                    visited.add((nr, nc))
                    queue.append((nr, nc, path_len + 1))
        
        return -1
    ```

    ```python
    def shortestPathBinaryMatrix(grid):
        import heapq
        
        n = len(grid)
        if grid[0][0] == 1 or grid[n-1][n-1] == 1:
            return -1
        
        def heuristic(row, col):
            return max(abs(row - (n-1)), abs(col - (n-1)))
        
        directions = [(-1,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,-1),(0,1),(1,-1),(1,0),(1,1)]
        heap = [(1 + heuristic(0, 0), 1, 0, 0)]  # (f_score, path_len, row, col)
        visited = {(0, 0)}
        
        while heap:
            _, path_len, row, col = heapq.heappop(heap)
            
            if row == n-1 and col == n-1:

            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and 
                    grid[nr][nc] == 0 and (nr, nc) not in visited):
                    visited.add((nr, nc))
                    f_score = path_len + 1 + heuristic(nr, nc)
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (f_score, path_len + 1, nr, nc))
        
        return -1

## Problem 3: Network Delay Time

=== "Problem Statement"
    **Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
    **Pattern**: Dijkstra's Algorithm / Shortest Path  
    **Time**: O(E log V), **Space**: O(V + E)

    You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (ui, vi, wi)`, where `ui` is the source node, `vi` is the target node, and `wi` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

    We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return the time it takes for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.

    **Example:**
    ```
    Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Signal path: 2â†’1 (time 1), 2â†’3â†’4 (time 2)
    ```

=== "Solution"
    ```python
    def networkDelayTime(times, n, k):
        import heapq
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        # Build adjacency list
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in times:
            graph[u].append((v, w))
        
        # Dijkstra's algorithm
        distances = {}
        heap = [(0, k)]  # (distance, node)
        
        while heap:
            dist, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
            
            if node in distances:
                continue
            
            distances[node] = dist
            
            for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in distances:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (dist + weight, neighbor))
        
        # Check if all nodes are reachable
        if len(distances) != n:
            return -1
        
        return max(distances.values())
    ```

=== "Alternative Solutions"
    **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:**
    ```python
    def networkDelayTime(times, n, k):
        distances = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        distances[k] = 0
        
        # Relax edges n-1 times
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            for u, v, w in times:
                if distances[u] + w < distances[v]:
                    distances[v] = distances[u] + w
        
        # Find maximum distance
        max_dist = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if distances[i] == float('inf'):
                return -1
            max_dist = max(max_dist, distances[i])
        
        return max_dist

## Problem 4: Is Graph Bipartite?

=== "Problem Statement"
    **Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
    **Pattern**: Graph Coloring / BFS/DFS  
    **Time**: O(V + E), **Space**: O(V)

    There is an undirected graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between `0` and `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[i]` is an array of the nodes that are adjacent to node `i`.

    Return `true` if and only if it is bipartite.

    A graph is bipartite if we can split its set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

    **Example:**
    ```
    Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
    Output: false
    Explanation: Cannot partition into two sets without adjacent nodes in same set.
    ```

=== "Solution"
    ```python
    def isBipartite(graph):
        """
        Color nodes with alternating colors.
        If we can color without conflicts, graph is bipartite.
        """
        n = len(graph)

            colors[node] = color
            
            # Color all neighbors with opposite color
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not dfs(neighbor, 1 - color):
                    return False
            
            return True
        
        # Check each component
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in colors:
                if not dfs(i, 0):
                    return False
        
        return True
    ```

=== "Alternative Solutions"
    **BFS Approach:**
    ```python
    def isBipartite(graph):
        from collections import deque
        
        n = len(graph)
        colors = {}
        
        for start in range(n):
            if start in colors:
                continue
            
            queue = deque([start])
            colors[start] = 0
            
            while queue:
                node = queue.popleft()

                    if neighbor in colors:
                        if colors[neighbor] == colors[node]:
                            return False
                    else:
                        colors[neighbor] = 1 - colors[node]
                        queue.append(neighbor)

    Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by `'X'`.

    A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

    **Example:**

## Problem 6: Find the Town Judge

=== "Problem Statement"
    **Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
    **Pattern**: Graph Properties / In-degree/Out-degree  
    **Time**: O(E), **Space**: O(V)

    In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

    If the town judge exists, then:
    1. The town judge trusts nobody.
    2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
    3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

    You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [ai, bi]` representing that person `ai` trusts person `bi`.

    Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return `-1` otherwise.

    **Example:**
    ```
    Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: Person 3 is trusted by 1 and 2, and trusts nobody.
    ```

=== "Solution"
    ```python
    def findJudge(n, trust):
        """
        Judge has in-degree n-1 and out-degree 0
        """
        if n == 1:
            return 1 if not trust else -1
        
        in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)
        out_degree = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for a, b in trust:
            out_degree[a] += 1
            in_degree[b] += 1
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if in_degree[i] == n - 1 and out_degree[i] == 0:

        """
        if n == 1:
            return 1 if not trust else -1
        
        trust_score = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for a, b in trust:
            trust_score[a] -= 1  # Trusts someone (out-degree)
            trust_score[b] += 1  # Is trusted (in-degree)

## Problem 12: Pacific Atlantic Water Flow

=== "Problem Statement"
    **Difficulty**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
    **Pattern**: Multi-source DFS/BFS  
    **Time**: O(MÃ—N), **Space**: O(MÃ—N)

    There is an `m x n` rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.

    The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `heights` where `heights[r][c]` represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate `(r, c)`.

    Return a list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

    **Example:**
    ```
    Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]

    You are also given some `queries`, where `queries[j] = [Cj, Dj]` represents the `j`th query where you must find the answer for `Cj / Dj = ?`.

    Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return `-1.0`.

# Advanced Techniques

Master advanced algorithmic paradigms and problem-solving techniques.

## Core Techniques

- **[Divide & Conquer](divide-conquer.md)** - Break problems into subproblems
- **[Greedy Algorithms](greedy.md)** - Make locally optimal choices

## When to Use Each

### Divide & Conquer
- Problem can be broken into similar subproblems
- Subproblems can be solved independently
- Solutions can be combined efficiently

**Examples**: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search, Maximum Subarray

### Greedy Algorithms  
- Problem has greedy choice property
- Local optimal leads to global optimal
- No need to reconsider previous choices

**Examples**: Activity Selection, Huffman Coding, Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Problem-Solving Strategies

1. **Identify the paradigm** - What type of problem is this?
2. **Check prerequisites** - Does the problem satisfy necessary conditions?
3. **Design the algorithm** - Apply the paradigm systematically
4. **Analyze complexity** - Time and space requirements
5. **Prove correctness** - Especially important for greedy algorithms

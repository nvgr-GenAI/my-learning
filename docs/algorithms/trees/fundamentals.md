# Tree Fundamentals ðŸŒ³

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of nodes connected by edges. Understanding tree fundamentals is essential for solving complex algorithmic problems and designing efficient systems.

=== "ðŸ“‹ Core Concepts"

    ## **Tree Terminology**
    
    | Term | Definition | Example |
    |------|------------|---------|
    | **Node** | Basic unit containing data | Each circle in a tree diagram |
    | **Edge** | Connection between nodes | Lines connecting nodes |
    | **Root** | Top node with no parent | Starting point of the tree |
    | **Leaf** | Node with no children | End nodes of branches |
    | **Parent** | Node with children | Node one level up |
    | **Child** | Node with a parent | Node one level down |
    | **Sibling** | Nodes with same parent | Nodes at same level |
    | **Ancestor** | All nodes on path to root | All nodes above current node |
    | **Descendant** | All nodes in subtree | All nodes below current node |
    | **Height** | Max distance from node to leaf | Longest path downward |
    | **Depth** | Distance from root to node | Path length from root |
    | **Level** | All nodes at same depth | Nodes at same distance from root |

=== "ðŸŒ² Tree Properties"

    ## **Binary Tree Properties**
    
    ```
    Maximum nodes at level i: 2^i
    Maximum nodes in tree of height h: 2^(h+1) - 1
    Minimum height with n nodes: âŒŠlogâ‚‚nâŒ‹
    Maximum height with n nodes: n - 1
    Number of leaf nodes in perfect binary tree: 2^h
    Number of internal nodes in perfect binary tree: 2^h - 1
    ```
    
    ## **Tree Type Definitions**
    
    - **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most 2 children (left and right)
    - **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right
    - **Full Binary Tree**: Every node has either 0 or 2 children (no node has exactly 1 child)
    - **Perfect Binary Tree**: All internal nodes have exactly 2 children and all leaf nodes are at the same level
    - **Balanced Binary Tree**: Height difference between left and right subtrees is at most 1 for all nodes
    - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: For each node, all values in left subtree â‰¤ node value â‰¤ all values in right subtree

    ## **Self-Balancing Trees**
    
    - **AVL Tree**: First self-balancing BST, maintains height balance factor (-1, 0, or 1) for each node
    - **Red-Black Tree**: Each node colored red or black, maintains color properties to ensure balance
    - **Splay Tree**: Recently accessed elements moved to root, good for caching
    - **B-Tree**: Generalizes BST by allowing nodes to have more than two children, optimized for disk operations
    
    ## **Advanced Tree Structures**
    
    - **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Character-based tree for efficient string operations
    - **Segment Tree**: Binary tree for range queries and updates in arrays
    - **Fenwick Tree (BIT)**: Efficiently updates and calculates prefix sums
    - **Heap**: Complete binary tree with heap property (parent â‰¥ or â‰¤ children)
    - **Suffix Tree**: Compressed trie containing all suffixes of a string
    
    ## **Tree Types**
    
    | Type | Properties | Use Cases |
    |------|------------|-----------|
    | **Binary Tree** | At most 2 children per node | General hierarchy |
    | **Complete** | All levels filled except possibly last | Heaps, efficient storage |
    | **Perfect** | All internal nodes have 2 children | Mathematical analysis |
    | **Balanced** | Height difference â‰¤ 1 | Guaranteed performance |
    | **Full** | Nodes have either 0 or 2 children | Expression trees |
    | **Skewed** | Each node has only 1 child | Degenerated cases |
    | **BST** | Left < Root < Right | Searching, sorting |
    | **AVL** | Self-balancing BST | Guaranteed O(log n) |
    | **Red-Black** | Colored nodes for balance | Standard library implementations |
    | **B-Tree** | Multi-way search tree | Databases, file systems |
    | **Trie** | Character-based tree | Dictionary, autocomplete |
    | **Segment Tree** | Range queries | Query optimizations |
    | **Heap** | Complete binary tree | Priority queues |

        if not root:
            return 0
        return 1 + count_nodes(root.left) + count_nodes(root.right)
    
    # Check if balanced
    def is_balanced(root):
        def check_balance(node):
            if not node:
                return 0, True
            
            left_height, left_balanced = check_balance(node.left)
            right_height, right_balanced = check_balance(node.right)
            
            balanced = (left_balanced and right_balanced and 
                       abs(left_height - right_height) <= 1)
            height = 1 + max(left_height, right_height)

# Tree Data Structures Documentation

## Structure Overview

This directory contains documentation for various Tree data structures organized into individual files for better readability and maintainability.

### Main Files

- `index.md` - Entry point with overview of all tree types
- `fundamentals.md` - Core concepts and principles for tree data structures (no traversals)
- `tree-traversal.md` - Dedicated guide to all tree traversal methods and implementations

### Tree-Specific Files

Each tree type has its own detailed file with a consistent tabbed structure:

1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of the tree type
2. **Overview Tab**: Core idea, when to use, time complexity, and real-world applications
3. **Properties/Structure Tab**: Detailed discussion of the tree's properties and structure
4. **Operations Tab**: Common operations (insert, delete, search) with explanations
5. **Implementation Tab**: Code examples and implementation techniques
6. **Problem Patterns Tab**: Common problem patterns solved with this tree type

## Tree Categories

### Basic Trees
- `binary-trees.md` - Foundation of tree structures
- `bst.md` - Binary search trees

### Balanced Trees
- `avl-trees.md` - Self-balancing binary search trees
- `red-black-trees.md` - Self-balancing trees with color properties
- `splay-trees.md` - Self-adjusting binary search trees
- `b-trees.md` - Multi-way search trees for disk-based systems

### Specialized Trees
- `tries.md` - Prefix trees for efficient string operations
- `suffix-trees.md` - Trees for substring operations
- `segment-trees.md` - Trees for range queries and updates
- `fenwick-trees.md` - Binary indexed trees for efficient cumulative operations

### Tree-Based Algorithms and Data Structures

- `heaps.md` - Binary heaps and priority queues
- `dsu.md` - Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find) data structure
- `cartesian-trees.md` - Tree structure for range minimum queries
- `heavy-light.md` - Heavy-Light Decomposition for path queries

### Problem Collections

- `easy-problems.md`, `medium-problems.md`, `hard-problems.md` - Problem sets by difficulty

## Style Guidelines

1. Use tabbed sections for clear organization of content
2. Include visualizations where possible
3. Provide both theoretical explanations and practical code examples
4. Link related concepts between files when relevant
5. Maintain consistent formatting across all documentation files

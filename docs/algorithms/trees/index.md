# Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures that are fundamental to computer science. Due to their complexity and importance, they deserve their own dedicated section.

## Tree Fundamentals

- **[Binary Trees](binary-trees.md)** - Basic tree structure with at most two children
- **[Binary Search Trees](bst.md)** - Ordered binary trees for efficient searching
- **[AVL Trees](avl-trees.md)** - Self-balancing BSTs for guaranteed performance
- **[Tree Traversal](tree-traversal.md)** - Methods to visit all nodes in a tree
- **[Tree Problems](tree-problems.md)** - Common coding problems and solutions

## Quick Overview

| Tree Type | Search | Insert | Delete | Use Case |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| Binary Tree | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) | General hierarchy |
| BST (balanced) | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) | Sorted data, searching |
| AVL Tree | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) | Guaranteed performance |
| Heap | O(n) | O(log n) | O(log n) | Priority queues |

## Why Trees Matter

- **Hierarchical Data**: File systems, organization charts, decision trees
- **Efficient Searching**: Binary search trees provide O(log n) operations
- **Database Indexing**: B-trees and B+ trees are used in database systems
- **Expression Parsing**: Abstract syntax trees in compilers
- **Game AI**: Decision trees and game state exploration

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Binary Trees** - Understand the basic structure
2. **Learn Tree Traversal** - DFS (inorder, preorder, postorder) and BFS
3. **Master Binary Search Trees** - Understand the ordering property
4. **Practice Tree Problems** - Build intuition with coding exercises
5. **Explore Advanced Trees** - AVL trees, Red-Black trees, etc.

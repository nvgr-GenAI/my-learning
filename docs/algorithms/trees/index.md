## 🎨 Tree Categories

### By Structure
| **Tree Type** | **Key Property** | **Time Complexity** | **Use Cases** |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Binary Tree** | At most 2 children | O(n) worst case | General hierarchy |
| **BST** | Left < Root < Right | O(log n) average | Searching, sorting |
| **AVL Tree** | Height-balanced | O(log n) guaranteed | Guaranteed performance |
| **Trie** | Character-based paths | O(m) where m = string length | String processing |
| **Segment Tree** | Range operations | O(log n) | Range queries |

### By Application
- **Database Indexing**: B-Trees, B+ Trees
- **String Processing**: Tries, Suffix Trees
- **Range Queries**: Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees
- **Priority Management**: Heaps
- **Graph Algorithms**: Spanning Trees, Union-Find

## 🔥 Why Trees Matter

Trees are essential because they:

- ✅ **Hierarchical Organization** - Natural representation of structured data
- ✅ **Efficient Operations** - O(log n) search, insert, delete in balanced trees
- ✅ **Range Processing** - Efficient range queries and updates
- ✅ **String Algorithms** - Powerful string matching and processing
- ✅ **System Design** - Database indexing, file systems, compilers

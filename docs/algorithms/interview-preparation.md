## üó£Ô∏è Communication Best Practices

### Before Coding
1. **Restate the problem** in your own words
2. **Ask clarifying questions** about edge cases
3. **Discuss your approach** before implementing
4. **Estimate complexity** and get agreement

### While Coding
1. **Think out loud** - explain your reasoning
2. **Start with brute force** if needed, then optimize
3. **Write readable code** with good variable names
4. **Handle edge cases** as you encounter them

### After Coding
1. **Walk through your solution** with examples
2. **Test edge cases** thoroughly
3. **Discuss optimizations** and alternative approaches
4. **Analyze complexity** clearly

### Example Communication Flow
```
"Let me understand the problem... we need to find two numbers that sum to target.
The array is sorted, which suggests we might use two pointers.

Let me clarify - can we use the same element twice? Are there always exactly 
two numbers that sum to target?

I'll use two pointers approach: start from both ends and move based on the sum.
This should be O(n) time and O(1) space.

[Implements solution while explaining each step]

Let me test this with the given example... [walks through]
For edge cases, what if the array is empty or has one element?

The time complexity is O(n) since we visit each element once.
Space complexity is O(1) as we only use two pointers."
```

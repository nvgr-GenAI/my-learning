## ðŸš€ Quick Reference

### Set Types Comparison

| **Set Type** | **Insert** | **Delete** | **Search** | **Memory** | **Best Use Case** |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| **Hash Set** | O(1) avg | O(1) avg | O(1) avg | O(n) | Fast lookups |
| **Tree Set** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(n) | Sorted order |
| **Bit Set** | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | O(k/8) | Integer ranges |

### Common Operations

```python
# Hash Set Operations
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.add(4)           # Add element
my_set.remove(2)        # Remove element  
my_set.discard(5)       # Remove if exists
print(3 in my_set)      # Membership test

# Set Operations
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
print(set1 | set2)      # Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(set1 & set2)      # Intersection: {3}
print(set1 - set2)      # Difference: {1, 2}
print(set1 ^ set2)      # Symmetric difference: {1, 2, 4, 5}
```

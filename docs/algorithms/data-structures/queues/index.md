# Queues

## üìö Overview

A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. Think of it like a line at a store - the first person in line is the first person to be served. Elements are added at one end (rear/back) and removed from the other end (front).

## üéØ What You'll Learn

This section covers everything you need to master queues:

### üìñ [Fundamentals & Theory](fundamentals.md)

- Queue concept and FIFO principle
- Basic operations (enqueue, dequeue, front, rear)
- Types of queues and their characteristics
- Time and space complexity analysis

### üèóÔ∏è Implementation Types

Master different queue implementations for various scenarios:

#### [üìò Array-Based Queue](array-queue.md){ .md-button }

**Fixed/Dynamic**: Simple array implementation

- Contiguous memory layout
- O(1) operations with proper indexing
- Best for predictable sizes

#### [üìó Linked List Queue](linked-list-queue.md){ .md-button }

**Dynamic**: Node-based implementation

- True dynamic sizing
- O(1) enqueue and dequeue
- Best for unpredictable sizes

#### [üìô Circular Queue](circular-queue.md){ .md-button }

**Space Efficient**: Ring buffer approach

- Reuses array positions
- Optimal for fixed buffers
- Common in systems programming

#### [üìï Priority Queue](priority-queue.md){ .md-button }

**Priority-Based**: Order by importance

- Elements served by priority
- Essential for algorithms
- Multiple implementation options

### üü¢ [Easy Problems](easy-problems.md)

Perfect for beginners to understand queue applications:

- Implement Queue using Stacks
- Number of Recent Calls
- Design Circular Queue

### üü° [Medium Problems](medium-problems.md)

Intermediate challenges using advanced queue techniques:

- Sliding Window Maximum
- Design Hit Counter
- Shortest Path in Binary Matrix
- Rotting Oranges
- Task Scheduler

### üî¥ [Hard Problems](hard-problems.md)

- Minimum Window Substring

## üöÄ Quick Start

If you're new to queues, start with **[Fundamentals & Theory](fundamentals.md)** to understand the core FIFO concept, then explore the **[Implementation Types](array-queue.md)** to see different approaches, and finally progress through problems based on your comfort level.

## üìä At a Glance

| **Operation** | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Enqueue** | O(1) | O(1) |
| **Dequeue** | O(1) | O(1) |
| **Front** | O(1) | O(1) |
| **Rear** | O(1) | O(1) |
| **isEmpty** | O(1) | O(1) |
| **Search** | O(n) | O(1) |

## üîÑ Queue Types Overview

### 1. **Simple Queue (Linear Queue)**

Basic FIFO implementation with front and rear pointers.

### 2. **Circular Queue (Ring Buffer)**

Efficient space utilization by wrapping around when reaching array end.

### 3. **Priority Queue**

Elements are served based on priority rather than insertion order.

### 4. **Double-Ended Queue (Deque)**

Allows insertion and deletion at both ends.

## üí° Pro Tips

!!! tip "When to Use Queues"
    - **Task scheduling**: Operating systems, print queues
    - **BFS traversal**: Level-order tree/graph traversal
    - **Buffering**: IO operations, streaming data
    - **Request handling**: Web servers, API rate limiting
    - **Sliding window**: Moving averages, range queries

!!! warning "Common Pitfalls"
    - Array-based queues can waste space (use circular queues)
    - Not checking for empty queue before dequeue
    - Confusion between queue and stack operations
    - Inefficient implementation leading to O(n) operations

!!! success "Best Practices"
    - Always check if queue is empty before dequeue/front
    - Use circular queues for fixed-size scenarios
    - Consider deque when you need both-end operations
    - Think about queues for level-by-level processing

# Stacks

## üìö Overview

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. Think of it like a stack of plates - you can only add or remove plates from the top. This makes stacks perfect for scenarios where you need to reverse the order of operations or keep track of nested structures.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

This section covers everything you need to master stacks:

### üìñ [Fundamentals & Operations](fundamentals.md)

- Stack concept and LIFO principle
- Implementation using arrays and linked lists  
- Basic operations (push, pop, peek, isEmpty)
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Applications and use cases

### üü¢ [Easy Problems](easy-problems.md)

Perfect for beginners to understand stack applications:

## üöÄ Quick Start

If you're new to stacks, start with **[Fundamentals](fundamentals.md)** to understand the core LIFO concept, then progress through problems based on your comfort level.

## üìä At a Glance

| **Operation** | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Push** | O(1) | O(1) |
| **Pop** | O(1) | O(1) |
| **Peek/Top** | O(1) | O(1) |
| **isEmpty** | O(1) | O(1) |
| **Search** | O(n) | O(1) |

## üí° Pro Tips

!!! tip "When to Use Stacks"
    - **Function calls**: Call stack management
    - **Undo operations**: Text editors, games
    - **Expression evaluation**: Mathematical expressions, compilers
    - **Backtracking**: Maze solving, tree traversal
    - **Parsing**: Nested structures, syntax checking

!!! warning "Common Pitfalls"
    - Stack overflow with recursive calls
    - Not checking for empty stack before pop
    - Forgetting to handle edge cases (empty stack, single element)

!!! success "Best Practices"
    - Always check if stack is empty before pop/peek
    - Use stacks for problems involving "matching" or "nesting"
    - Consider stack when you need to reverse order of processing
    - Think about monotonic stacks for "next greater/smaller" problems

## üîÑ Real-World Applications

### Programming Language Features

- **Function call management**: Call stack
- **Memory management**: Stack frame allocation
- **Expression parsing**: Infix to postfix conversion

### Software Applications

- **Undo/Redo functionality**: Text editors, image editors
- **Browser history**: Back button navigation
- **Compiler design**: Syntax checking, code generation

### Algorithms

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Tree and graph traversal
- **Backtracking algorithms**: N-Queens, Sudoku solving
- **Dynamic Programming**: Some DP problems use stack for optimization

# Convex Hull

## üéØ Overview

The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points. It can be visualized as the shape formed by stretching a rubber band around all the points. This fundamental geometric construction has applications in various fields including computer graphics, pattern recognition, geographic information systems (GIS), and robotics.

## üìã Core Concepts

### Properties of a Convex Hull

1. All points in the original set are either inside the hull or on its boundary
2. All internal angles of the hull are less than 180 degrees
3. The hull is the smallest convex polygon containing all points
4. Only a subset of the original points (those on the boundary) form the hull

### Algorithms Classification

Convex hull algorithms can be classified based on:

- **Dimension**: 2D, 3D, or higher dimensions
- **Output Sensitivity**: Whether the time complexity depends on output size
- **Execution Strategy**: Incremental, divide-and-conquer, gift wrapping, etc.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Implementations

### Graham Scan Algorithm

The Graham scan is an efficient algorithm that builds the convex hull in O(n log n) time:

```python
def graham_scan(points):
    """
    Compute the convex hull of a set of 2D points using Graham's scan algorithm.
    
    Args:
        points: List of (x, y) tuples representing points in 2D space
        
    Returns:
        List of (x, y) tuples representing vertices of the convex hull in counterclockwise order
    """
    def orientation(p, q, r):
        """
        Determine orientation of triplet (p, q, r).
        Returns:
            0: Collinear
            1: Clockwise
            2: Counterclockwise
        """
        val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])
        if abs(val) < 1e-10:
            return 0
        return 1 if val > 0 else 2
    
    # Find the point with the lowest y-coordinate (and leftmost if tied)
    lowest = min(points, key=lambda p: (p[1], p[0]))
    
    # Sort points by polar angle with respect to the lowest point
    sorted_points = sorted(
        points, 
        key=lambda p: (
            math.atan2(p[1] - lowest[1], p[0] - lowest[0]), 
            (p[0] - lowest[0])**2 + (p[1] - lowest[1])**2
        )
    )
    
    # Remove duplicates
    i = 1
    while i < len(sorted_points):
        if sorted_points[i] == sorted_points[i-1]:
            sorted_points.pop(i)
        else:
            i += 1
    
    # Build the hull
    hull = []
    for p in sorted_points:
        # Remove points that make non-left turns
        while len(hull) > 1 and orientation(hull[-2], hull[-1], p) != 2:
            hull.pop()
        hull.append(p)
    
    return hull
```

### Jarvis March (Gift Wrapping) Algorithm

Jarvis march is a simple algorithm with O(nh) time complexity where h is the number of hull vertices:

```python
def jarvis_march(points):
    """
    Compute the convex hull of a set of 2D points using the Jarvis march algorithm.
    
    Args:
        points: List of (x, y) tuples representing points in 2D space
        
    Returns:
        List of (x, y) tuples representing vertices of the convex hull in counterclockwise order
    """
    def orientation(p, q, r):
        """Calculate orientation of triplet (p, q, r)"""
        val = (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - q[1])
        if abs(val) < 1e-10:
            return 0
        return 1 if val > 0 else 2
    
    n = len(points)
    if n < 3:
        return points
    
    # Find the leftmost point
    l = min(range(n), key=lambda i: points[i][0])
    
    hull = []
    p = l
    
    while True:
        hull.append(points[p])
        
        # Find the next point on hull
        q = (p + 1) % n
        for i in range(n):
            # If i is more counterclockwise than current q, update q
            if orientation(points[p], points[i], points[q]) == 2:
                q = i
        
        p = q
        
        # Break when we get back to the first point
        if p == l:
            break
    
    return hull
```

### QuickHull Algorithm

QuickHull is a divide-and-conquer algorithm with worst-case O(n¬≤) but typically better performance:

        max_point = None
        for p in points:
            dist = distance_from_line(p, a, b)
            if dist > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist
                max_point = p
        
        if max_point is None:
            return
        
        # Add the point to the hull
        hull.add(max_point)
        
        # Find points on the right of lines a-max_point and max_point-b
        s1 = [p for p in points if is_right_of_line(p, a, max_point)]

        # Recursively process the two subsets
        find_hull(s1, a, max_point, hull)
        find_hull(s2, max_point, b, hull)
    
    def distance_from_line(p, a, b):
        """Calculate the perpendicular distance from point p to line ab"""
        return abs((b[1]-a[1])*p[0] - (b[0]-a[0])*p[1] + b[0]*a[1] - b[1]*a[0]) / \
               ((b[1]-a[1])**2 + (b[0]-a[0])**2)**0.5

    """

    This is not a complete implementation but outlines the approach.
    """

## üåü Pro Tips

- For 2D hulls, Graham scan is generally the most efficient for most cases
- If you expect few points on the hull, consider Jarvis march or Chan's algorithm
- For numerical stability, consider sorting points lexicographically instead of by angle
- In 3D and higher dimensions, the implementation complexity increases significantly
- Preprocessing points (e.g., removing duplicates) can improve performance
- For very large point sets, consider parallelizing the computation
- Libraries like CGAL, PCL, or scipy.spatial provide robust implementations
- When working with integer coordinates, be careful with potential overflows

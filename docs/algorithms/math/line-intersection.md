# Line Intersection

## üéØ Overview

Line intersection is a fundamental problem in computational geometry that involves determining whether and where two or more lines meet. This concept has broad applications in computer graphics, robotics, geographic information systems (GIS), and many other fields that require spatial analysis and visualization.

## üìã Core Concepts

### Types of Line Intersections

1. **Line-Line Intersection**: Determining where two infinite lines meet
2. **Line Segment Intersection**: Finding where two bounded line segments intersect
3. **Ray-Line Intersection**: Computing where a ray (semi-infinite line) meets a line
4. **Multiple Line Intersections**: Identifying all intersection points among multiple lines

### Coordinate Systems

Most line intersection algorithms work in:
- 2D Cartesian coordinates (x,y)
- 3D space (x,y,z)
- Homogeneous coordinates for projective geometry

### Representation of Lines

Lines can be represented in different ways:
- **Parametric Form**: p(t) = p‚ÇÄ + t ¬∑ v (point + direction)
- **Implicit Form**: ax + by + c = 0
- **Slope-Intercept Form**: y = mx + b
- **Two-Point Form**: Through points p‚ÇÅ and p‚ÇÇ

### Bentley-Ottmann Algorithm for Line Segment Intersections

The Bentley-Ottmann algorithm is an efficient sweep line algorithm for finding all intersections among a set of line segments. It has a time complexity of O((n + k) log n), where n is the number of segments and k is the number of intersections.

    among a set of line segments.

## üåü Pro Tips

- Always handle special cases (parallel lines, collinear points)
- Use robust geometric predicates to avoid numerical issues
- For many segments, use sweep line algorithms rather than checking all pairs
- Consider using integer arithmetic or fixed-point representations for better numerical stability
- When working with floating point, use appropriate epsilon values for equality tests
- Precompute and cache results when processing multiple queries
- Consider specialized libraries like CGAL for production code
- For 3D applications, consider projective geometry and homogeneous coordinates

# Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

## 🎯 Overview

The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle is a fundamental counting technique in combinatorics that allows us to calculate the size of the union of multiple sets. It's particularly useful when sets have overlapping elements, making direct counting difficult. This principle extends to probability theory and has numerous applications in computer science algorithms.

## 📋 Core Concepts

### Basic Principle

For two sets A and B, the size of their union is:
|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|

For three sets A, B, and C:
|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

### General Formula

For n sets A₁, A₂, ..., Aₙ:

$$|A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_n| = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |A_i| - \sum_{i<j} |A_i \cap A_j| + \sum_{i<j<k} |A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k| - ... + (-1)^{n+1} |A_1 \cap A_2 \cap ... \cap A_n|$$

In simpler terms:
- Add the sizes of individual sets
- Subtract the sizes of all pairwise intersections
- Add the sizes of all three-way intersections
- Subtract the sizes of all four-way intersections
- Continue alternating addition and subtraction until you reach the n-way intersection

    """
    n = len(sets)
    result = 0
    
    # Iterate through all possible subsets using bit manipulation
    for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
        # Find which sets are in the current intersection
        intersection_size = len(sets[0].copy())
        sign = -1
        
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & (1 << i):
                if sign == -1:
                    intersection_size = len(sets[i].copy())
                    sign = 1
                else:
                    intersection_size = len(sets[i] & intersection_set)
                
                if intersection_size == 0:
                    break
                
                intersection_set = sets[i].copy()
        
        # Apply the principle with appropriate sign
        contribution = intersection_size * (1 if bin(mask).count('1') % 2 == 1 else -1)
        result += contribution
    
    return result

    import itertools
    total = 0
    
    # For each size k of combinations
    for k in range(1, len(properties) + 1):

        sign = (-1)**(k-1)
        for combo in itertools.combinations(range(len(properties)), k):
            # Count integers satisfying all properties in the combination
            count = 0
            for i in range(1, n + 1):
                # Check if i satisfies all properties in combo
                if all(properties[idx](i) for idx in combo):
                    count += 1
            
            # Add or subtract according to inclusion-exclusion
            total += sign * count
    
    return total

## 🌟 Pro Tips

- For large numbers of sets, consider using dynamic programming techniques
- When dealing with numerical properties, look for mathematical shortcuts
- The principle can be generalized to probability calculations with P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B)
- Be careful with sign alternation: odd-sized intersections add, even-sized intersections subtract
- In some cases, you can optimize by recognizing patterns in the intersections
- For large n, consider using approximate methods or sampling techniques
- Complement counting ("count elements not in any set") can sometimes simplify the problem

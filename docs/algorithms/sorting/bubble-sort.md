# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they're in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

=== "ðŸ“‹ Algorithm Overview"

    ## Key Characteristics
    
    - **Time Complexity**: 
      - Best Case: O(n) - when the array is already sorted
      - Average/Worst Case: O(nÂ²)
    - **Space Complexity**: O(1)
    - **Stable**: Yes - maintains the relative order of equal elements
    - **In-place**: Yes - requires only constant extra space
    - **Adaptive**: Yes - performs better when array is partially sorted
    
    ## When to Use
    
    - Educational purposes - to understand basic sorting concepts
    - Small data sets where simplicity is preferred over efficiency
    - Nearly sorted data where few swaps are needed
    - When memory usage is a concern (since it's in-place)
    - When stability is required
    
    ## Advantages and Disadvantages
    
    ### Advantages
    - Simple implementation
    - Stable sorting algorithm
    - In-place (requires no additional memory)
    - Works well for small or nearly sorted arrays
    
    ### Disadvantages
    - Inefficient for large data sets with O(nÂ²) time complexity
    - Generally performs worse than insertion sort
    - Excessive swapping operations

=== "ðŸ”„ How It Works"

    ## Algorithm Steps
    
    1. Start at the beginning of the array
    2. Compare adjacent elements (arr[j] and arr[j+1])
    3. Swap them if they're in the wrong order
    4. Continue to the end of the unsorted portion
    5. After each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position
    6. Repeat until no swaps are needed in a pass
    
    ## Optimization
    
    - Track whether any swaps occurred during a pass
    - If no swaps occur, the array is already sorted and we can exit early
    - This optimization gives bubble sort O(n) performance for already sorted arrays
    
    ## Visual Example
    
    Initial array: `[64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]`
    
    **Pass 1:**
    
    ```
    [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90] â†’ [34, 64, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90] (swap)
    [34, 64, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90] â†’ [34, 25, 64, 12, 22, 11, 90] (swap)
    [34, 25, 64, 12, 22, 11, 90] â†’ [34, 25, 12, 64, 22, 11, 90] (swap)
    [34, 25, 12, 64, 22, 11, 90] â†’ [34, 25, 12, 22, 64, 11, 90] (swap)
    [34, 25, 12, 22, 64, 11, 90] â†’ [34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 64, 90] (swap)
    ```
    
    After Pass 1: `[34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 64, 90]` (90 is in correct position)
    
    **Pass 2:**
    
    ```
    [34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 64] â†’ [25, 34, 12, 22, 11, 64] (swap)
    [25, 34, 12, 22, 11, 64] â†’ [25, 12, 34, 22, 11, 64] (swap)
    [25, 12, 34, 22, 11, 64] â†’ [25, 12, 22, 34, 11, 64] (swap)
    [25, 12, 22, 34, 11, 64] â†’ [25, 12, 22, 11, 34, 64] (swap)
    ```
    
    After Pass 2: `[25, 12, 22, 11, 34, 64, 90]` (64 and 90 are in correct positions)
    
    **Passes 3-6:**
    
    Continue until the array is fully sorted: `[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]`

    ```

=== "ðŸ“Š Performance Analysis"

    ## Time Complexity
    
    - **Best Case**: O(n) - When array is already sorted (with optimization)
    - **Average Case**: O(nÂ²)
    - **Worst Case**: O(nÂ²) - When array is sorted in reverse order
    
    ## Space Complexity
    
    - O(1) - Only requires constant extra space regardless of input size
    
    ## Comparison with Other Simple Sorts
    
    | Algorithm | Best | Average | Worst | Space | Stable | In-Place |
    |-----------|------|---------|-------|-------|--------|----------|
    | Bubble Sort | O(n) | O(nÂ²) | O(nÂ²) | O(1) | Yes | Yes |
    | Selection Sort | O(nÂ²) | O(nÂ²) | O(nÂ²) | O(1) | No | Yes |
    | Insertion Sort | O(n) | O(nÂ²) | O(nÂ²) | O(1) | Yes | Yes |
    
    ## Performance Factors
    
    1. **Swapping Overhead** - Bubble sort typically performs more swaps than other algorithms
    2. **Cache Performance** - Good locality of reference when working with adjacent elements
    3. **Array Size Impact** - Dramatic slowdown as array size increases due to O(nÂ²) complexity

=== "ðŸ’¡ Applications & Variations"

    ## Real-world Applications
    
    - **Educational tool** - Used to teach basic sorting concepts
    - **Small datasets** - When simplicity is more important than efficiency
    - **Nearly sorted data** - Can perform well when most elements are in the right place
    - **Embedded systems** - When memory is extremely limited and code simplicity is valued
    
    ## Variations
    
    ### 1. Cocktail Shaker Sort (Bidirectional Bubble Sort)
    
    Sorts in both directions, moving the smallest elements to the beginning and largest to the end:
    
    ```python
    def cocktail_sort(arr):
        n = len(arr)
        swapped = True
        start = 0
        end = n - 1
        
        while swapped:
            swapped = False
            
            # Forward pass (move largest to the end)
            for i in range(start, end):
                if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
                    arr[i], arr[i + 1] = arr[i + 1], arr[i]
                    swapped = True
            
            if not swapped:
                break
            
            end -= 1
            swapped = False
            
            # Backward pass (move smallest to the beginning)
            for i in range(end - 1, start - 1, -1):
                if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
                    arr[i], arr[i + 1] = arr[i + 1], arr[i]
                    swapped = True
            
            start += 1
    ```
    
    ### 2. Odd-Even Sort
    
    A parallel version of bubble sort that alternates between comparing odd/even indexed pairs and even/odd indexed pairs:
    
    ```python
    def odd_even_sort(arr):
        n = len(arr)
        sorted = False
        
        while not sorted:
            sorted = True
            
            # Odd-even pairs
            for i in range(1, n-1, 2):
                if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
                    arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
                    sorted = False
            
            # Even-odd pairs
            for i in range(0, n-1, 2):
                if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
                    arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
                    sorted = False
    ```
    
    ### 3. Comb Sort
    
    An improvement over bubble sort that eliminates "turtles" (small values near the end of the list):
    
    ```python
    def comb_sort(arr):
        n = len(arr)
        gap = n
        shrink = 1.3
        sorted = False
        
        while not sorted:
            # Update gap
            gap = int(gap / shrink)
            if gap <= 1:
                gap = 1
                sorted = True
            
            i = 0
            while i + gap < n:
                if arr[i] > arr[i + gap]:
                    arr[i], arr[i + gap] = arr[i + gap], arr[i]
                    sorted = False
                i += 1
    ```

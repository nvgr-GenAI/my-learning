# Bucket Sort

Bucket Sort is a distribution-based sorting algorithm that works by distributing elements into a number of buckets, then sorting these buckets individually and finally merging them to produce a sorted array.

=== "ðŸ“‹ Algorithm Overview"

    ## Key Characteristics
    
    - **Time Complexity**: 
      - Average: O(n + k) where k is the number of buckets
      - Worst: O(nÂ²) when elements are clustered in a single bucket
    - **Space Complexity**: O(n + k)
    - **Stable**: Yes (if the underlying sort is stable)
    - **In-place**: No
    - **Comparison-based**: Depends on the algorithm used to sort individual buckets
    
    ## When to Use
    
    - When input is uniformly distributed over a range
    - For floating-point numbers in a known range
    - When linear-time sorting is needed and data distribution is favorable
    - As an external sorting algorithm
    
    ## Limitations
    
    - Inefficient when data is not uniformly distributed
    - Requires knowledge about data distribution
    - Extra space overhead for buckets
    - Performance heavily dependent on the hash/bucket function

=== "ðŸ”„ How It Works"

    ## Algorithm Steps
    
    1. Create n empty buckets (or fewer based on the range)
    2. Scatter: Place each element into its corresponding bucket based on a bucket function
    3. Sort each non-empty bucket (using any sorting algorithm or recursively using bucket sort)
    4. Gather: Visit the buckets in order and put all elements back into the original array
    
    ## Visual Example
    
    Original array: `[0.42, 0.32, 0.33, 0.52, 0.37, 0.47, 0.51]`
    
    **Scatter phase (with 5 buckets):**
    - Bucket 0 (0.0-0.2): Empty
    - Bucket 1 (0.2-0.4): [0.32, 0.33, 0.37]
    - Bucket 2 (0.4-0.6): [0.42, 0.47, 0.52, 0.51]
    - Bucket 3 (0.6-0.8): Empty
    - Bucket 4 (0.8-1.0): Empty
    
    **Sort individual buckets:**
    - Bucket 1: [0.32, 0.33, 0.37]
    - Bucket 2: [0.42, 0.47, 0.51, 0.52]
    
    **Gather phase:**
    - Final sorted array: [0.32, 0.33, 0.37, 0.42, 0.47, 0.51, 0.52]

    ## Generic Bucket Sort for Integer Range

        """
        Bucket Sort implementation for integers in any range

    ```

=== "ðŸ“Š Performance Analysis"

    ## Time Complexity
    
    - **Best Case**: O(n) - When elements are perfectly distributed and each bucket has â‰¤ 1 element
    - **Average Case**: O(n + k) - When elements are uniformly distributed
    - **Worst Case**: O(nÂ²) - When all elements are placed in a single bucket
    
    Where:
    - n = array size
    - k = number of buckets
    
    ## Space Complexity
    
    - O(n + k) for the buckets and temporary storage
    
    ## Distribution Impact
    
    The performance of bucket sort heavily depends on the distribution of the input data:
    
    | Data Distribution | Performance |
    |-------------------|-------------|
    | Uniform           | Excellent - O(n) |
    | Normal            | Good - O(n + k) |
    | Skewed/Clustered  | Poor - O(nÂ²) |
    
    ## Bucket Size Trade-offs
    
    | Number of Buckets | Benefits | Drawbacks |
    |-------------------|----------|-----------|
    | Many small buckets | Better distribution | Higher overhead |
    | Few large buckets | Lower overhead | More work sorting each bucket |
    
    Optimal bucket number is often close to the array size (n).
    
    ## Stability
    
    Bucket sort is stable if the algorithm used to sort individual buckets is stable.

=== "ðŸ’¡ Applications & Variations"

    ## Real-world Applications
    
    - **Database systems**: For sorting records by a numeric key
    - **Geographic information systems**: Sorting locations by coordinates
    - **External sorting**: When data doesn't fit in memory
    - **Image processing**: Color quantization and histograms
    - **Network routing tables**: IP address sorting
    
    ## Variations
    
    ### 1. Generic Bucket Sort
    
    Uses a hash function to map elements to buckets:
    
    ```python
    def generic_bucket_sort(arr, hash_function, num_buckets):
        """Bucket sort using a custom hash function"""
        buckets = [[] for _ in range(num_buckets)]
        
        for item in arr:
            buckets[hash_function(item) % num_buckets].append(item)
            
        result = []
        for bucket in buckets:
            # Use insertion sort for each bucket (good for small arrays)
            insertion_sort(bucket)
            result.extend(bucket)
            
        return result
    ```
    
    ### 2. Recursive Bucket Sort
    
    Uses recursion for large buckets:
    
    ```python
    def recursive_bucket_sort(arr, min_val, max_val, depth=0, max_depth=2):
        """Recursive bucket sort for better handling of skewed distributions"""
        if len(arr) <= 1 or depth >= max_depth:
            return sorted(arr)
            
        num_buckets = min(len(arr), 10)  # Adjust based on array size
        range_size = (max_val - min_val) / num_buckets
        buckets = [[] for _ in range(num_buckets)]
        
        # Distribute elements
        for item in arr:
            bucket_idx = min(num_buckets - 1, 
                             int((item - min_val) / range_size))
            buckets[bucket_idx].append(item)
        
        # Recursively sort large buckets
        result = []
        for i, bucket in enumerate(buckets):
            if len(bucket) > 10:  # Threshold for recursion
                bucket_min = min_val + i * range_size
                bucket_max = bucket_min + range_size
                result.extend(recursive_bucket_sort(
                    bucket, bucket_min, bucket_max, depth + 1, max_depth))
            else:
                result.extend(sorted(bucket))
                
        return result
    ```
    
    ### 3. Parallel Bucket Sort
    
    ```python
    def parallel_bucket_sort(arr, num_buckets, num_threads):
        """Parallel implementation of bucket sort using threads"""
        # Find range
        min_val, max_val = min(arr), max(arr)
        range_size = (max_val - min_val) / num_buckets
        
        # Create buckets and distribute elements
        buckets = [[] for _ in range(num_buckets)]
        for item in arr:
            bucket_idx = min(num_buckets - 1, 
                             int((item - min_val) / range_size))
            buckets[bucket_idx].append(item)
            
        # Sort buckets in parallel
        def sort_bucket(bucket):
            bucket.sort()
            
        threads = []
        for bucket in buckets:
            if bucket:  # Only process non-empty buckets
                thread = Thread(target=sort_bucket, args=(bucket,))
                threads.append(thread)
                thread.start()
                
                # Limit active threads
                if len(threads) >= num_threads:
                    threads[0].join()
                    threads.pop(0)
                    
        # Wait for remaining threads
        for thread in threads:
            thread.join()
            
        # Gather results
        result = []
        for bucket in buckets:
            result.extend(bucket)
            
        return result
    ```

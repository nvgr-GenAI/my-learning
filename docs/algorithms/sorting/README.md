## Documentation Style

Each algorithm documentation follows a consistent tabbed structure for better organization:

1. **ðŸ“‹ Algorithm Overview** - Key characteristics, when to use, advantages/disadvantages
2. **ðŸ”„ How It Works** - Step-by-step explanation of the algorithm with visual examples
3. **ðŸ’» Implementation** - Code samples in multiple languages or variations
4. **ðŸ“Š Performance Analysis** - Time/space complexity analysis and comparison with other algorithms
5. **ðŸ’¡ Applications & Variations** - Real-world uses and algorithm variations
6. **ðŸŽ¯ Practice Problems** - Problems to solve using the algorithm

## Contribution Guidelines

When adding or editing documentation for sorting algorithms:

1. **Maintain the tabbed structure** for consistency across all algorithm pages.
2. **Include visual examples** to help readers understand the algorithm steps.
3. **Provide performance analysis** with best, average, and worst-case scenarios.
4. **Add practical code implementations** that are well-commented and efficient.
5. **Include practice problems** with varying difficulty levels.
6. **Keep the navigation structure** in `mkdocs.yml` updated when adding new algorithms.

## To-Do List

- [ ] Add visualizations to all sorting algorithm pages
- [ ] Complete the analysis sections for all algorithms
- [ ] Standardize code examples across all pages
- [ ] Add more practice problems with solutions
- [ ] Create comparison charts between different algorithms
- [ ] Add interactive examples if possible

## Reference Style Guide

### Code Blocks

Use language-specific code blocks with proper syntax highlighting:

```python
def example_sort(arr):
    # Implementation
    return sorted_array
```

### Complexity Tables

Use consistent formatting for complexity tables:

| Algorithm | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space | Stable | In-Place |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|------------|-------|--------|----------|
| Example Sort | O(n) | O(n log n) | O(nÂ²) | O(n) | Yes | No |

### Cross-References

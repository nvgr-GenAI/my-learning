# RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)

This section covers Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, a technique for aligning language models with human preferences.

## Overview

RLHF is a training paradigm that uses human feedback to improve language model outputs by:

- Learning from human preferences
- Aligning with human values
- Improving output quality
- Reducing harmful content

## Core Components

### Three-Stage Process

**Stage 1: Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)**
- Train on high-quality human demonstrations
- Learn basic task completion
- Establish baseline performance

**Stage 2: Reward Model Training**
- Collect human preference data
- Train reward model on comparisons
- Learn human value function

**Stage 3: Reinforcement Learning**
- Use reward model to train policy
- Optimize for human preferences
- Balance exploration and exploitation

## Technical Details

### Reward Model

The reward model learns to predict human preferences:

```python
# Reward model architecture
class RewardModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, base_model):
        super().__init__()
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.reward_head = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
    
    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
        outputs = self.base_model(input_ids, attention_mask)
        reward = self.reward_head(outputs.last_hidden_state[:, -1])
        return reward
```

### Policy Training

Using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) for training:

- Collect rollouts from current policy
- Calculate rewards using reward model
- Update policy using PPO objectives
- Maintain KL divergence constraint

### KL Divergence Constraint

Preventing the model from deviating too far from the original:

```
objective = reward - β * KL(π_θ || π_ref)
```

Where:
- π_θ is the current policy
- π_ref is the reference model
- β controls the constraint strength

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Collection

**Demonstration Data:**
- High-quality human responses
- Diverse task coverage
- Consistent formatting

**Preference Data:**
- Pairwise comparisons
- Ranking annotations
- Quality ratings

### 2. Supervised Fine-tuning

```python
# SFT training loop
for batch in sft_dataloader:
    outputs = model(**batch)
    loss = F.cross_entropy(outputs.logits, batch['labels'])
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

### 3. Reward Model Training

```python
# Reward model training
for batch in preference_dataloader:
    reward_chosen = reward_model(batch['chosen'])
    reward_rejected = reward_model(batch['rejected'])
    loss = -F.logsigmoid(reward_chosen - reward_rejected)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

### 4. PPO Training

```python
# PPO training loop
for batch in ppo_dataloader:
    # Generate responses
    responses = model.generate(**batch)
    
    # Calculate rewards
    rewards = reward_model(responses)
    
    # PPO update
    ppo_loss = compute_ppo_loss(responses, rewards)
    ppo_loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

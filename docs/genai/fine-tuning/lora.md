# LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)

This section covers Low-Rank Adaptation, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for large language models.

## Overview

LoRA is a technique that allows efficient fine-tuning of large language models by:

- Reducing the number of trainable parameters
- Maintaining model performance
- Enabling faster training
- Reducing memory requirements

## Core Concepts

### Low-Rank Decomposition

LoRA works by decomposing weight updates into low-rank matrices:

```
W = W₀ + ΔW
ΔW = AB
```

Where:
- W₀ is the original pretrained weight
- A and B are low-rank matrices
- ΔW is the weight update

### Parameter Efficiency

Instead of updating all parameters, LoRA only trains the low-rank matrices:

- Original model: billions of parameters
- LoRA adaptation: thousands of parameters
- Significant reduction in computational cost

## Technical Details

### Rank Selection

Choosing the appropriate rank for the decomposition:

- Lower rank: fewer parameters, faster training
- Higher rank: more expressiveness, better performance
- Typical values: 4, 8, 16, 32

### Target Modules

Common modules to apply LoRA to:

- Query and Value projections in attention
- Key projections (sometimes)
- Feed-forward layers
- Output layers

### Scaling Factor

The alpha parameter controls the magnitude of adaptations:

```
scaling = alpha / rank
```

## Implementation

### Basic LoRA Setup

```python
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model

# Configure LoRA
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,  # rank
    lora_alpha=32,  # alpha parameter
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"],
    lora_dropout=0.1,
)

# Apply LoRA to model
model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)
```

### Training Process

Step-by-step training with LoRA:

1. Load pretrained model
2. Apply LoRA configuration
3. Freeze original parameters
4. Train only LoRA parameters
5. Merge or save adapters

## Advantages

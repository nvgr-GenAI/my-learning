# Diffusion Models

Diffusion models for high-quality generative modeling through denoising processes.

## Overview
Diffusion models generate data by learning to reverse a noise corruption process.

## Types
- Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
- Score-based models
- Stochastic Differential Equations
- Latent diffusion models

## Training Process
- Forward diffusion process
- Reverse denoising process
- Noise scheduling
- Loss functions

## Applications
- Image generation
- Audio synthesis
- 3D modeling
- Video generation

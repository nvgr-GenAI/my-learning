# GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)

This section covers Generative Adversarial Networks and their applications.

## Overview

GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks where two neural networks compete in a zero-sum game.

## Architecture

### Generator
- Creates synthetic data
- Learns data distribution
- Adversarial training
- Noise-to-data mapping

### Discriminator
- Distinguishes real from fake
- Binary classification
- Provides feedback
- Adversarial loss

## Training Process

### Adversarial Loss
- Minimax game
- Nash equilibrium
- Training stability
- Convergence challenges

### Optimization

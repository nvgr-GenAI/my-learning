# Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

!!! success "Next-Level Prompting"
    Master sophisticated prompting strategies including chain-of-thought, few-shot learning, and advanced reasoning patterns.

## Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the model to break down complex reasoning into step-by-step explanations.

### Basic Chain-of-Thought

**Example:**

```text
Question: A baker has 24 cupcakes. She sells 3/4 of them in the morning 
and 1/3 of the remaining cupcakes in the afternoon. How many cupcakes 
does she have left?

Let me work through this step by step:
1. First, calculate morning sales: 24 × 3/4 = 18 cupcakes sold
2. Remaining after morning: 24 - 18 = 6 cupcakes
3. Afternoon sales: 6 × 1/3 = 2 cupcakes sold
4. Final remaining: 6 - 2 = 4 cupcakes

Answer: The baker has 4 cupcakes left.
```

### Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought

Simply add "Let's think step by step" to enable reasoning.

### Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought

Provide examples with reasoning chains.

```text
Q: If a company's revenue grew from $100M to $150M, what was the growth rate?
A: Let me calculate this step by step:
1. Growth amount: $150M - $100M = $50M
2. Growth rate: ($50M / $100M) × 100% = 50%
Answer: 50% growth rate.

Q: A product's price increased from $80 to $92. What's the percentage increase?
A: Let me work through this:
1. Price increase: $92 - $80 = $12
2. Percentage increase: ($12 / $80) × 100% = 15%
Answer: 15% increase.

Q: Sales dropped from 1000 units to 750 units. What's the decline rate?
A: [Model completes with step-by-step reasoning]

## Tree-of-Thought (ToT) Prompting

Explores multiple reasoning paths simultaneously for complex problem-solving.

```text
Problem: Design a sustainable urban transportation system for a city of 2 million people.

Let's explore multiple approaches:

**Path 1: Public Transit Focus**
- Extensive metro/bus network
- Benefits: High capacity, proven technology
- Challenges: High infrastructure cost, construction time

**Path 2: Micro-Mobility Integration**
- Bikes, scooters, walking infrastructure
- Benefits: Flexible, low cost, health benefits
- Challenges: Weather dependent, limited range

**Path 3: Smart Traffic Management**
- AI-optimized traffic flow, dynamic pricing
- Benefits: Uses existing infrastructure, immediate impact
- Challenges: Requires behavior change, technology deployment

**Path 4: Hybrid Approach**
- Combine all above with zone-based strategies
- Benefits: Comprehensive solution, addresses diverse needs
- Challenges: Complex coordination, higher planning requirements

Evaluation: Path 4 offers the most balanced solution...
```

## Self-Consistency Prompting

Generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most consistent answer.

```text
Problem: A store offers a 20% discount on all items. If an item originally 
costs $125, and there's an additional 5% tax, what's the final price?

**Approach 1:**
1. Apply discount: $125 × 0.8 = $100
2. Apply tax: $100 × 1.05 = $105
Final: $105

**Approach 2:**
1. Discount amount: $125 × 0.2 = $25
2. Price after discount: $125 - $25 = $100
3. Tax amount: $100 × 0.05 = $5
4. Final price: $100 + $5 = $105
Final: $105

**Approach 3:**
1. Discounted price: $125 - ($125 × 0.2) = $100
2. With tax: $100 + ($100 × 0.05) = $105
Final: $105

Consistent answer: $105
```

## Program-Aided Language (PAL) Models

Combine natural language reasoning with code execution.

```text
Problem: Calculate the compound interest on $5,000 invested at 6% annual 
interest rate for 3 years, compounded monthly.

Let me solve this step by step with calculations:

```python
# Given values
principal = 5000  # Initial amount
annual_rate = 0.06  # 6% annual rate
time_years = 3
compounds_per_year = 12  # Monthly compounding

# Compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
monthly_rate = annual_rate / compounds_per_year
total_periods = compounds_per_year * time_years

final_amount = principal * (1 + monthly_rate) ** total_periods
compound_interest = final_amount - principal

print(f"Final amount: ${final_amount:.2f}")
print(f"Compound interest earned: ${compound_interest:.2f}")
```

Result: The investment grows to $5,983.40, earning $983.40 in compound interest.

## ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Pattern

Combines reasoning with action-taking for interactive problem-solving.

```text
Task: Research and compare the market share of the top 3 cloud providers.

**Thought:** I need to find current market share data for cloud providers. 
Let me search for recent industry reports.

**Action:** Search for "cloud computing market share 2024"

**Observation:** Found recent data showing AWS leads with ~32%, followed by 
Microsoft Azure at ~23%, and Google Cloud at ~10%.

**Thought:** I should verify this with multiple sources and get more specific 
data about different cloud services.

**Action:** Cross-reference with Gartner and IDC reports

**Observation:** Gartner confirms similar figures: AWS 31%, Azure 24%, 
Google Cloud 11% for IaaS market.

**Thought:** Now I can provide a comprehensive comparison with reliable data.

**Answer:** Based on 2024 industry reports:
1. **AWS**: ~31-32% market share, leading in IaaS and overall cloud services
2. **Microsoft Azure**: ~23-24% market share, strong growth in enterprise
3. **Google Cloud**: ~10-11% market share, growing rapidly from smaller base

Sources: Gartner Magic Quadrant, IDC MarketScape 2024 reports.
```

## Prompt Chaining

Break complex tasks into sequential, manageable steps.

```text
**Step 1 Prompt:** "Analyze this business case and identify the key challenges: [business case]"

**Step 2 Prompt:** "Based on these challenges: [output from step 1], brainstorm 5 potential solutions for each challenge."

**Step 3 Prompt:** "Evaluate these solutions: [output from step 2] using criteria: feasibility, cost, timeline, and impact. Rank each solution."

**Step 4 Prompt:** "Create an implementation roadmap for the top 3 solutions: [output from step 3] with specific milestones and resource requirements."
```

## Constitutional AI Principles

Guide model behavior through explicit principles and self-critique.

```text
Task: Write a product review for a smartphone.

Constitutional Principles:
1. Be honest and balanced - mention both pros and cons
2. Base claims on verifiable features, not speculation
3. Consider different user needs and use cases
4. Avoid marketing language or bias
5. Include practical usage insights

Now, critique your response against these principles and revise if needed.

[Model generates review, then critiques and revises it]
```

## Role-Based Prompting with Expertise

Leverage specific domain knowledge through role assignment.

```text
You are Dr. Sarah Chen, a senior data scientist with 15 years of experience 
in machine learning at Fortune 500 companies. You've led teams that built 
recommendation systems for e-commerce platforms and fraud detection systems 
for financial institutions.

A startup founder asks: "We have 100,000 users and want to build a 
recommendation system. What approach would you recommend for our first MVP?"

Respond as Dr. Chen would, drawing on your specific experience with 
production ML systems, considering practical constraints like team size, 
data availability, and time-to-market pressures.
```

## Metacognitive Prompting

Encourage the model to think about its own thinking process.

```text
Before answering this question about quantum computing applications, 
let me first consider:

1. What do I know with high confidence about this topic?
2. What areas might have uncertainty or require caveats?
3. What assumptions am I making?
4. How can I structure my response to be most helpful?
5. What follow-up questions might the user have?

Now, let me answer: [original question]

[After providing the answer]

Let me reflect on my response:
- Did I address all aspects of the question?
- Are there any gaps or biases in my reasoning?
- What additional context might be valuable?
```

## Advanced Few-Shot Techniques

### Analogical Reasoning

```

### Contrastive Prompting

```text
Good Example:
Input: "Explain photosynthesis"
Output: "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, 
carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen using chlorophyll..."

Bad Example:
Input: "Explain photosynthesis"
Output: "Plants make food from sun and stuff and it's green because of leaves..."

Now explain: How does cellular respiration work?
```

## Prompt Optimization Strategies

### 1. Temperature and Parameter Tuning

```text
For Creative Tasks (Temperature 0.8-1.0):
"Write a creative story about time travel with unexpected plot twists."

For Analytical Tasks (Temperature 0.1-0.3):
"Calculate the return on investment for this marketing campaign: [data]"

For Balanced Tasks (Temperature 0.5-0.7):
"Explain the pros and cons of remote work policies."
```

### 2. Iterative Refinement

```text
Version 1: "Summarize this article"
Version 2: "Summarize this article in 3 bullet points"
Version 3: "Summarize this article in 3 bullet points, focusing on actionable insights"
Version 4: "Summarize this article in 3 bullet points, focusing on actionable insights for marketing managers"
```

### 3. Multi-Modal Integration

```text
Analyze the attached image and data table together:

Image: [Sales performance chart]
Data: [Monthly sales figures CSV]

Task: Identify trends that are visible in the chart but might not be 
obvious from the raw numbers alone. Consider seasonal patterns, 
growth acceleration/deceleration, and anomalies.

Format your analysis as:
1. Visual insights from the chart
2. Quantitative insights from the data
3. Combined insights from both sources
4. Recommendations based on the complete picture
```

## Error Recovery and Robustness

### Handling Ambiguous Inputs

```text
When you encounter an ambiguous request, use this structure:

1. Acknowledge the ambiguity
2. List possible interpretations
3. Ask for clarification OR provide the most likely interpretation
4. Offer to adjust based on feedback

Example:
"I notice your request about 'optimizing the model' could mean several things:
a) Improving model accuracy/performance
b) Reducing computational costs
c) Speeding up training time
d) Making the model more interpretable

I'll assume you mean improving accuracy (most common request), but please 
let me know if you meant something else..."
```

### Graceful Degradation

```text
Primary approach: [Detailed technical analysis]

If technical details aren't accessible:
Fallback approach: [High-level conceptual explanation]

If domain knowledge is insufficient:
Alternative approach: [General framework with caveats]

If question is outside scope:
Response: "This is outside my expertise area, but here's what I can offer: [related insights] and here's who might help: [relevant experts/resources]"
```

# Prompting Fundamentals

!!! info "Foundation Knowledge"
    Understanding the core principles of effective prompt design and communication with AI systems.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing text inputs to guide AI language models toward producing desired outputs. It combines technical understanding with creative problem-solving to achieve reliable, consistent results.

### Key Concepts

**Prompt Components:**

- **Task Description**: What you want the AI to do
- **Context**: Background information and constraints
- **Examples**: Sample inputs and outputs (few-shot learning)
- **Format**: How you want the output structured
- **Role**: The persona or expertise level for the AI

## Anatomy of an Effective Prompt

```text
[ROLE] You are an expert [domain] consultant.

[CONTEXT] Given the following information: [background details]

[TASK] Please [specific action/request]

[FORMAT] Present your response as:
1. [Structure element 1]
2. [Structure element 2]
3. [Structure element 3]

[EXAMPLES] 
Input: [example input]
Output: [example output]

[CONSTRAINTS]
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]
```

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity and Specificity

**❌ Vague Prompt:**

```text
Write about AI.
```

**✅ Clear Prompt:**

```text
Write a 500-word executive summary explaining how large language models 
can improve customer service operations, including 3 specific use cases 
and potential ROI considerations for a mid-size e-commerce company.
```

### 2. Context Setting

**❌ No Context:**
```
Calculate the marketing budget.
```

**✅ Rich Context:**
```
You are a marketing director at a B2B SaaS company with $10M ARR. 
Calculate an optimal marketing budget allocation for Q1 2024, considering:
- 40% growth target
- Focus on enterprise clients
- Current CAC of $2,000
- LTV of $50,000
```

### 3. Format Specification

**❌ Unstructured:**
```
Analyze this dataset and tell me what you find.
```

**✅ Structured:**
```
Analyze the attached sales dataset and provide:

## Executive Summary
[2-3 key insights]

## Detailed Findings
1. **Trend Analysis**: [patterns over time]
2. **Segment Performance**: [breakdown by customer type]
3. **Anomalies**: [unusual patterns or outliers]

## Recommendations
- [Actionable recommendation 1]
- [Actionable recommendation 2]
- [Actionable recommendation 3]
```

## Prompt Types and Use Cases

### 1. Instruction Prompts
Direct commands for specific tasks.

```
Summarize the following research paper in 200 words, focusing on 
methodology and key findings: [paper content]
```

### 2. Conversational Prompts
Multi-turn interactions for complex problem-solving.

```
I'm planning a machine learning project to predict customer churn. 
Let's discuss the approach step by step. First, what data would you 
recommend collecting?
```

### 3. Few-Shot Prompts
Learning from examples.

```
Classify these customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral:

Review: "Great product, fast shipping!"
Sentiment: Positive

Review: "Product broke after one week"
Sentiment: Negative

Review: "It's okay, nothing special"
Sentiment: Neutral

Review: "Amazing quality and excellent customer service!"
Sentiment: [to be classified]
```

### 4. Zero-Shot Prompts
Tasks without examples.

```
Extract the main topics discussed in this meeting transcript and 
rank them by importance: [transcript]
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### 1. Ambiguous Instructions

**Problem:** The AI doesn't understand what you want.

**Solution:** Be explicit about:
- Output format
- Level of detail
- Perspective/audience
- Constraints

### 2. Information Overload

**Problem:** Too much context confuses the model.

**Solution:** 
- Prioritize essential information
- Use clear section headers
- Break complex requests into steps

### 3. Assuming Context

**Problem:** Not providing enough background.

**Solution:**
- Include relevant domain knowledge
- Define specialized terms
- Set appropriate scope

### 4. Inconsistent Format

**Problem:** Results vary widely in structure.

**Solution:**
- Use templates
- Provide explicit formatting rules
- Include structural examples

## Prompt Testing and Iteration

### 1. Start Simple
Begin with a basic prompt and gradually add complexity.

```
Version 1: "Explain machine learning"
Version 2: "Explain machine learning for business executives"
Version 3: "Explain machine learning for business executives in 300 words, 
           focusing on ROI and implementation challenges"
```

### 2. Test Variations
Try different phrasings for the same request.

```
Variation A: "List the benefits of cloud computing"
Variation B: "What are the advantages of cloud computing?"
Variation C: "Enumerate the key benefits organizations gain from cloud computing"
```

### 3. Validate Outputs
Check results against your criteria:
- ✅ Accuracy
- ✅ Completeness
- ✅ Format compliance
- ✅ Tone appropriateness

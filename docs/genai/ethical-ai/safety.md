# Safety

This section covers safety considerations and measures for generative AI systems.

## Overview

AI safety ensures that AI systems operate safely and do not cause harm to users or society.

## Safety Risks

### System Failures
- Model errors and failures
- Unexpected behaviors
- Performance degradation
- Security vulnerabilities

### Misuse Risks

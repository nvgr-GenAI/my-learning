## Key Concepts

### Ethical Principles

1. **Beneficence**: AI should benefit humanity
2. **Non-maleficence**: AI should not cause harm
3. **Autonomy**: Respect for human agency
4. **Justice**: Fair distribution of benefits and risks
5. **Transparency**: Openness in AI decision-making

### Fairness Metrics

- **Statistical Parity**: Equal outcomes across groups
- **Equal Opportunity**: Equal true positive rates
- **Equalized Odds**: Equal true positive and false positive rates
- **Individual Fairness**: Similar individuals receive similar outcomes

### Privacy Techniques

- **Differential Privacy**: Mathematical privacy guarantees
- **Federated Learning**: Decentralized training
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Computation on encrypted data
- **Secure Multi-party Computation**: Privacy-preserving collaboration

## Practical Applications

### Healthcare AI Ethics
```python
# Example: Bias detection in medical AI
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from fairlearn.metrics import demographic_parity_difference

def evaluate_medical_ai_fairness(y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features):
    """
    Evaluate fairness of medical AI across demographic groups
    """
    # Calculate demographic parity
    dp_diff = demographic_parity_difference(
        y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features=sensitive_features
    )
    
    # Group-specific performance metrics
    groups = sensitive_features.unique()
    metrics = {}
    
    for group in groups:
        mask = sensitive_features == group
        group_y_true = y_true[mask]
        group_y_pred = y_pred[mask]
        
        tn, fp, fn, tp = confusion_matrix(group_y_true, group_y_pred).ravel()
        
        metrics[group] = {
            'accuracy': (tp + tn) / (tp + tn + fp + fn),
            'sensitivity': tp / (tp + fn) if (tp + fn) > 0 else 0,
            'specificity': tn / (tn + fp) if (tn + fp) > 0 else 0,
            'ppv': tp / (tp + fp) if (tp + fp) > 0 else 0
        }
    
    return {
        'demographic_parity_difference': dp_diff,
        'group_metrics': metrics
    }
```

### Differential Privacy Implementation
```python
import numpy as np

class DifferentialPrivacy:
    def __init__(self, epsilon=1.0):
        self.epsilon = epsilon
    
    def laplace_mechanism(self, true_value, sensitivity):
        """
        Add Laplace noise for differential privacy
        """
        scale = sensitivity / self.epsilon
        noise = np.random.laplace(0, scale)
        return true_value + noise
    
    def gaussian_mechanism(self, true_value, sensitivity, delta=1e-5):
        """
        Add Gaussian noise for (ε, δ)-differential privacy
        """
        sigma = np.sqrt(2 * np.log(1.25 / delta)) * sensitivity / self.epsilon
        noise = np.random.normal(0, sigma)
        return true_value + noise
    
    def private_mean(self, data, data_range):
        """
        Compute differentially private mean
        """
        true_mean = np.mean(data)
        sensitivity = (data_range[1] - data_range[0]) / len(data)
        return self.laplace_mechanism(true_mean, sensitivity)
```

# Privacy

This section covers privacy considerations and protection techniques in generative AI systems.

## Overview

Privacy protection is essential for maintaining user trust and complying with regulations.

## Privacy Risks

### Data Collection
- Personal information exposure
- Behavioral profiling
- Sensitive data leakage
- Inference attacks

### Model Training
- Data memorization
- Membership inference
- Attribute inference
- Model inversion

### Inference
- Input reconstruction
- Output correlation
- Side-channel attacks
- Timing attacks

## Privacy-Preserving Techniques

### Differential Privacy
- Statistical privacy guarantees
- Noise addition mechanisms
- Privacy budgets
- Composition theorems

### Federated Learning
- Distributed training
- Local data retention
- Secure aggregation
- Privacy-preserving protocols

### Homomorphic Encryption
- Computation on encrypted data
- Fully homomorphic encryption
- Somewhat homomorphic encryption
- Practical limitations

## Implementation Strategies

### Data Minimization
- Collect only necessary data
- Purpose limitation
- Retention limits
- Secure deletion

### Anonymization
- De-identification techniques
- K-anonymity
- L-diversity
- T-closeness

### Secure Multi-party Computation
- Collaborative computation
- Privacy-preserving protocols
- Secret sharing
- Garbled circuits

## Best Practices

### Design Principles
- Privacy by design
- Data minimization
- Transparency
- User control

### Technical Measures
- Encryption
- Access controls
- Audit logging
- Monitoring

### Governance
- Privacy policies
- Impact assessments
- Regular audits
- Compliance monitoring

# Bias & Fairness

This section covers bias detection, mitigation, and fairness considerations in generative AI systems.

## Overview

Bias and fairness are critical concerns in AI systems that can perpetuate or amplify societal inequalities.

## Types of Bias

### Data Bias
- Historical bias in training data
- Representation bias
- Sampling bias
- Measurement bias

### Algorithmic Bias
- Model architecture bias
- Training process bias
- Optimization bias
- Evaluation bias

### Deployment Bias
- User interaction bias
- Feedback loops
- Distribution shifts
- Context-dependent bias

## Fairness Metrics

### Individual Fairness
- Similar treatment for similar individuals
- Counterfactual fairness
- Causal fairness
- Consistency measures

### Group Fairness
- Demographic parity
- Equalized odds
- Equal opportunity
- Calibration

## Bias Detection

### Data Analysis
- Statistical analysis
- Representation analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Intersectional analysis

### Model Evaluation
- Performance disparities
- Error analysis
- Fairness metrics
- Stress testing

## Mitigation Strategies

### Pre-processing
- Data augmentation
- Resampling techniques
- Synthetic data generation
- Bias-aware data collection

### In-processing
- Fairness-aware training
- Adversarial debiasing
- Constraint-based optimization
- Multi-objective optimization

### Post-processing
- Output adjustment
- Threshold optimization
- Calibration techniques
- Fairness-aware ranking

## Best Practices

### Development
- Diverse teams
- Inclusive design
- Stakeholder engagement
- Continuous monitoring

### Evaluation
- Multiple metrics
- Intersectional analysis
- User studies
- External audits

### Deployment
- Monitoring systems
- Feedback mechanisms
- Regular audits
- Transparency measures

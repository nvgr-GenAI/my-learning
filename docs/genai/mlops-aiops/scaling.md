# Scaling

This section covers scaling strategies for generative AI systems.

## Overview

Scaling ensures AI systems can handle varying loads efficiently and cost-effectively.

## Horizontal Scaling

### Load Balancing
- Distribute requests across multiple instances
- Health checks and failover
- Geographic distribution
- Traffic routing algorithms

### Auto-scaling
- Metric-based scaling
- Predictive scaling
- Scaling policies
- Resource optimization

## Vertical Scaling

### Resource Optimization
- CPU and memory tuning
- GPU utilization
- Storage optimization
- Network bandwidth

### Performance Tuning
- Model optimization
- Caching strategies
- Connection pooling
- Batch processing

## Best Practices

### Monitoring
- Track key metrics
- Set up alerts
- Performance analysis
- Capacity planning

### Cost Management
- Right-sizing resources
- Spot instances
- Reserved capacity
- Resource scheduling

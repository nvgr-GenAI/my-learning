# RAG Implementation

This section covers practical implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems.

## Overview

RAG implementation involves several key components:
- Document ingestion and preprocessing
- Vector embeddings creation
- Vector database setup
- Retrieval mechanisms
- Generation pipeline

## Core Components

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline

```python
# Document ingestion example
def process_documents(documents):
    # Preprocessing steps
    pass
```

### 2. Vector Store Setup

Configuration and setup of vector databases for efficient similarity search.

### 3. Retrieval Pipeline

Implementation of the retrieval mechanism that finds relevant context.

### 4. Generation Pipeline

Integration with LLMs for final response generation.

## Implementation Patterns

### Basic RAG Implementation

Step-by-step guide to implementing a basic RAG system.

### Advanced RAG Patterns

More sophisticated implementations with multiple retrievers and re-ranking.

## Best Practices

- Chunking strategies
- Embedding selection
- Retrieval optimization
- Response quality evaluation

## Common Challenges

- Latency optimization
- Relevance scoring

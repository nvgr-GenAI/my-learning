# Vector Databases for RAG

!!! abstract "Vector Storage & Retrieval"
    Comprehensive guide to vector databases, their role in RAG systems, and implementation strategies.

## Introduction to Vector Databases

### What are Vector Databases?

Vector databases are specialized data storage systems designed to efficiently store, index, and retrieve high-dimensional vector embeddings. Unlike traditional databases that store structured data, vector databases are optimized for similarity search operations on dense numerical vectors.

**Key Characteristics**:

- **High-Dimensional Storage**: Handle vectors with hundreds to thousands of dimensions
- **Similarity Search**: Find vectors most similar to a query vector
- **Scalability**: Handle millions to billions of vectors efficiently
- **Real-time**: Support both batch and real-time operations

### Why Vector Databases for RAG?

**Semantic Similarity**: Traditional keyword search fails to capture semantic meaning. Vector databases enable semantic search by representing text as embeddings in a continuous vector space.

**Efficient Retrieval**: RAG systems need to quickly find relevant documents from large knowledge bases. Vector databases provide sub-linear search complexity.

**Dynamic Updates**: Knowledge bases frequently change. Vector databases support real-time insertions, updates, and deletions.

**Multimodal Support**: Modern RAG systems work with text, images, and audio. Vector databases can store embeddings from different modalities.

## Vector Database Architecture

### Core Components

#### Vector Storage

**Dense Vectors**: Most common format for embeddings
- Fixed dimensionality (e.g., 768, 1024, 1536)
- Floating-point values (typically float32)
- Memory and storage intensive

**Sparse Vectors**: Alternative representation
- Most values are zero
- Efficient storage for sparse embeddings
- Useful for traditional IR features

#### Indexing Structures

**Flat Index (Exhaustive Search)**:
- Compares query against every stored vector
- Guarantees exact results
- O(n) complexity - doesn't scale

**Inverted File (IVF)**:
- Clusters vectors into groups
- Search only relevant clusters
- Trade-off between speed and accuracy

**Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)**:
- Graph-based indexing
- Excellent speed/accuracy trade-off
- Popular in production systems

**Product Quantization (PQ)**:
- Compresses vectors for storage
- Reduces memory requirements
- Faster search with slight accuracy loss

#### Similarity Metrics

**Cosine Similarity**:
```text
cosine(u, v) = (u · v) / (||u|| × ||v||)
```
- Range: [-1, 1]
- Measures angle between vectors
- Invariant to vector magnitude

**Euclidean Distance**:
```text
euclidean(u, v) = ||u - v||₂
```
- Measures geometric distance
- Sensitive to vector magnitude
- Lower values indicate higher similarity

**Dot Product**:
```text
dot(u, v) = u · v
```
- Raw vector multiplication
- Combines magnitude and direction
- Efficient to compute

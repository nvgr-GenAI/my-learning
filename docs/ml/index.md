## Code Examples

Here's a simple example of linear regression:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.randn(100, 1)
y = 2 * X.squeeze() + 1 + np.random.randn(100) * 0.1

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print(f"Coefficient: {model.coef_[0]:.2f}")
print(f"Intercept: {model.intercept_:.2f}")
print(f"RÂ² Score: {model.score(X_test, y_test):.3f}")
```

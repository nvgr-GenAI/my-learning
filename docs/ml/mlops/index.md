# MLOps - Machine Learning Operations

## Overview

MLOps is the practice of deploying and maintaining machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently. It combines Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering practices.

## Core Components

### Model Development Lifecycle

#### 1. Data Management
- Data versioning and lineage
- Data quality monitoring
- Feature stores
- Data pipeline orchestration

#### 2. Model Training
- Experiment tracking
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model versioning
- Reproducible training environments

#### 3. Model Deployment
- Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
- CI/CD pipelines for ML
- A/B testing frameworks
- Canary deployments

#### 4. Model Monitoring
- Performance degradation detection
- Data drift monitoring
- Model drift monitoring
- Alerting and notifications

# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Introduction

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

## Core Concepts

### Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Classification
   - Regression
   - Examples: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Clustering
   - Dimensionality Reduction
   - Examples: K-Means, PCA, DBSCAN

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Agent-based learning
   - Reward optimization
   - Examples: Q-Learning, Policy Gradients

## Key Components

### Data
- Feature engineering
- Data preprocessing
- Data quality and validation

### Models
- Algorithm selection
- Model complexity
- Bias-variance tradeoff

### Evaluation
- Cross-validation
- Performance metrics
- Overfitting and underfitting

## Learning Path

1. **Foundation**: Statistics, Linear Algebra, Python
2. **Basic Algorithms**: Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees
3. **Advanced Methods**: Ensemble Methods, Neural Networks
4. **Specialized Topics**: Time Series, NLP, Computer Vision

## Tools and Libraries

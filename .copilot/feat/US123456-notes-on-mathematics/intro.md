# US123456 - Notes on Mathematics Feature

# 📘 Introduction

## 👋 Context
Machine learning and AI models heavily rely on a solid mathematical foundation—covering topics such as linear algebra, calculus, probability, and optimization. Yet many practitioners learn these math concepts in isolation, without seeing how they tie directly to model behavior. This tutorial is designed to bridge that gap by teaching the math *in context* of real ML/AI use cases.

## 🎯 Problem
- Students often struggle to connect abstract math to ML algorithms.
- Existing math courses don’t typically show how theory drives model design and implementation.
- As a result, learners may lack the intuition to troubleshoot model issues, derive new algorithms, or understand research papers.

## 🛠 Goal
- Provide clear explanations of key math concepts *via* practical examples from ML/AI.
- Show step-by-step derivations of core formulas.
- Reinforce intuition with visualizations and interactive code.
- Help learners go beyond “black-box” use of libraries—by understanding underlying math.

## ⚙️ Constraints
- Focus on fundamental topics: linear algebra, probability, calculus, and optimization.
- Use Python and Jupyter notebooks for demonstrations.
- Keep math rigorous but accessible—no more than advanced-undergrad level.
- Target audience: programmers with some ML experience but limited formal math background.

## ✅ Success Criteria
- Learner can *derive and explain* the gradient of a linear regression cost function.
- Learner can *compute eigen-decompositions* to perform PCA.
- Learner feels confident explaining how gradient descent works and tuning its hyperparameters.
- Learner can apply chain rule to derive backpropagation for a simple neural network.

## 👥 Stakeholders
- **Learners**: developers, data scientists, and ML enthusiasts aiming to deepen their math intuition.
- **Instructors/authors**: educators who’ll adapt modules as teaching material.
- **Tooling team**: responsible for producing clean, reproducible notebooks, figures, and quizzes.
